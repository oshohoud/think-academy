She may have a good grasp of the math concepts, but it is difficult to tell with English instruction. This week's lesson was particularly heavy in reading and understanding English since we were writing algebraic expressions to represent different situations. I would recommend that she take a Chinese math evaluation if possible, and that if she continues with Think, she registers for a class with a teacher fluent in Chinese (there are many!).
