    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. Address the parent by name (use \"Parent\" if no name provided)\n",

    "4. Do not mention the specific areas that the in-class questions covered, beyond the general subject matter covered in the lesson. That information is not available to you.\n",
    "5. There is no need to mention detailed attendance data (e.g. how many minutes the student did or did not attend) if the student attended the entire lesson or was entirely absent.\n",
    "6. If the student was partially absent, describe attendance data in minutes, not percentages. Since the full class time is 90 minutes, you would say to the parent of a child who missed 10% of the class that the child \"missed 9 minutes of class\". Round to the nearest minute.\n",
    "7. Unless otherwise specified in the above instructions, mention and comment on the student's homework score (as a percentage). If the student did not complete the homework, say they did not complete it and encourage them to complete it. Do not provide feedback about specific questions on the homework, since that information is not available to you\n",
    "8. Provide actionable recommendations based on the data\n",
    "9. If student was absent, focus on homework feedback and offer catch-up resources\n",
    "10. If provided above, include the in-class report link at the end of the email and mention to the parent they can find more detailed performance information in it.\n",
    "11. Be encouraging but honest about areas needing improvement\n",
    "12. Include relevant resources based on student's needs. If recommending 1-on-1 tutoring, include the tutoring link in the email.\n",
    "13. Keep tone warm, professional, and personalized\n",
    "14. Keep the feedback part (not including extra section) between 200-300 words. If the extra section is present, it should be written ABOVE/BEFORE the main email body and is not included in the word count. If an extra section was not mentioned, ignore this instruction.\n",
    "15. Do NOT use generic template language\n",
    "16. Do NOT include a subject at the top of the email body\n",
    "17. Do NOT use asterisks ** to indicate bold, this is for markdown and does not work for plain text.\n",
    "18. After the English email, write the exact same email translated into Mandarin Chinese.\n",

Students in the US, Canada, and China can purchase physical gifts with their hard-earned coins during this time. Students outside these regions can still purchase digital gifts, such as gift cards and e-books. The coin mall can be accessed through the parent app (tap your name, then the coins next to your student's name) or through the student app (tap the student's coins on the left). Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\n---\\n\\nI hope this email finds you well! I'm writing to touch base about Peggy's progress this week in math class.\\n\\nI noticed that Peggy was absent from class this week, when we covered subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators\\u2014an important skill that builds on her previous learning. I understand that things come up unexpectedly, and I appreciate it when families can give me a heads-up about absences so we can plan accordingly. If there are scheduling challenges or if Peggy needs to adjust her class time, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help make things work for her.\\n\\nMore importantly, I'd like to encourage Peggy to complete her homework from last week on addition of mixed numbers. Staying current with homework is crucial for reinforcing what we learn in class and preparing for upcoming topics. Additionally, Peggy missed the stage test covering lessons 9-12, which students took at the end of class. I'd like her to complete this assessment as soon as possible\\u2014she can find it in the Think Student app between lessons 12 and 13.\\n\\nTo support Peggy in catching up, I'd like to remind you of the resources available: supplemental problems in the workbook, additional practice problems upon request, and my office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on Think Student app. If Peggy would benefit from more personalized support, I also offer up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nLet's work together to get Peggy back on track.

Alice can purchase physical gifts with her hard-earned coins during this time if she's in the US, Canada, or China. Students outside these regions can still purchase digital gifts, such as gift cards and e-books. The coin mall can be accessed through the parent app (tap your name, then the coins next to Alice's name) or through the student app (tap the student's coins on the left). Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\n---\\n\\nHi Wincy,\\n\\nI wanted to share some wonderful news about Alice's progress this week in math class! She's been engaged and attentive throughout our lessons on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, and I've really appreciated seeing her camera consistently on and actively participating.\\n\\nAlice answered 8 in-class questions this week, getting 5 completely correct. She did encounter some challenges with Question #7 and Question #4, where she had difficulty with the concept. Question #6 went unanswered. These are great opportunities for her to deepen her understanding, and I'm confident that with a bit more practice, she'll master these skills.\\n\\nOn her homework covering addition of mixed numbers, Alice scored an impressive 92%, which shows she's grasping these concepts well! I'd like to encourage her to watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and solidify her understanding. Additionally, Alice earned an 87% on our stage test covering lessons 9 through 12, which is a solid performance.\\n\\nTo help Alice continue building confidence with mixed numbers, I recommend she work through the extra supplemental problems in the workbook. She's also welcome to request additional practice problems from me anytime. If she'd like more personalized support, my office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where we can work through any tricky problems together. She can also book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JwoMqD\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in Alice's learning!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher

She did an excellent job during our lessons on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. Katherine answered all 8 in-class questions correctly, which shows she is mastering the core concepts and applying them confidently. Her engagement in class was strong\\u2014she was attentive throughout and kept her camera on, which helps her stay connected with the lesson.\\n\\nKatherine missed just 1 minute of class this week, stepping out briefly near the end. Sometimes things come up, and I understand that, but I do encourage her to stay until the end so she doesn\\u2019t miss any important wrap-up or quiz time. This week\\u2019s stage test, which covered lessons 9 through 12, was completed after class, and she scored 86%, which is a solid result.\\n\\nHer previous homework score was 65%. I recommend that Katherine watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes to reinforce her understanding.

I wanted to share some positive updates about Ivan's progress in math this week.\\n\\nIvan demonstrated excellent engagement and participation during our lessons on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. He answered 8 in-class questions with strong accuracy, getting 7 completely correct. He did find Question #1 challenging, but this is a great learning opportunity, and I'm confident he'll master this skill with a bit more practice.\\n\\nI'm also thrilled to report that Ivan earned a perfect 100% on his previous homework assignment on addition of mixed numbers. That's fantastic work! This week's stage test, which covered topics from lessons 9 through 12, resulted in a score of 75%. While this shows solid understanding, there's room for growth, and I'd like to help him strengthen these concepts.\\n\\nHere are my recommendations to support Ivan's continued progress:\\n\\n- Have him watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and reinforce his problem-solving approach\\n- Practice the supplemental problems available in the workbook for additional reinforcement\\n- Join me for office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for targeted homework and workbook support\\n- Consider booking one of his three complimentary 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nIvan is clearly capable and engaged\\u2014with a little extra practice on these concepts, he'll be even more confident moving forward. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can view his in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JMDGKW\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Cinly\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eabIvan\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u66f4\\u65b0\\u3002\\n\\nIvan\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u51fa\\u8272\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u548c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u6027\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e868\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u51c6\\u786e\\u5ea6\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d7\\u9053\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6311\\u6218\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u591a\\u52a0\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u4f1a\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u9879\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u5730\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff0cIvan\\u5728\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u5b8c\\u7f8e\\u7684100%\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff0c\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u662f\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u52a0\\u6cd5\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u51fa\\u8272\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u8bd5\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u4e86\\u7b2c9\\u81f312\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\uff0cIvan\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4e8675\\u5206\\u3002\\u867d\\u7136\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u6709\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u4ecd\\u6709\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u7684\\u7a7a\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u6211\\u652f\\u6301Ivan\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u7684\\u5efa\\u8bae\\uff1a\\n\\n- \\u8ba9\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u9519\\u8bef\\u5e76\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u89e3\\u9898\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\n- \\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7406\\u89e3\\n- \\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u52a0\\u5165\\u6211\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u6027\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u652f\\u6301\\n- \\u8003\\u8651\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u4ed6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u4e09\\u4e2a\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e4b\\u4e00\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nIvan\\u663e\\u7136\\u5f88\\u6709\\u80fd\\u529b\\u4e14\\u79ef\\u6781\\u6295\\u5165\\u2014\\u2014\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u4f1a\\u53d8\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u52a0\\u81ea\\u4fe1\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u7591\\u8651\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6709\\u5173\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u5904\\u67e5\\u770b\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JMDGKW\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Rui has shown great focus and engagement in class this week, consistently keeping their camera on and participating attentively as we worked through subtraction of mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators. They answered 7 out of 8 in-class questions correctly, which is a strong performance. The one question Rui struggled with was question #8, and I will continue to support them in mastering these concepts.\\n\\nFor homework, Rui scored 87% on addition of mixed numbers, which is a solid result. I encourage Rui to watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and reinforce their understanding. Additionally, they recently completed a stage test covering lessons 9 through 12 with an 86% score, showing steady progress.\\n\\nTo further support Rui\\u2019s learning, extra practice problems are available in the supplemental workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide more upon request. Rui is also welcome to join my office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for extra help, or schedule one of up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. \\n\\nPlease feel free to review the detailed in-class performance report for more insights: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JPao48.

Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share some feedback about Samuel\\u2019s progress in math this week. We focused on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, including how to borrow from the whole number when needed. Samuel was engaged and attentive during class, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on throughout our session.\\n\\nSamuel answered 6 questions in class, getting 2 correct and 4 incorrect. The questions he struggled with were #2, #3, #5, and #6. He missed 1 minute of class, leaving a bit early. Sometimes things come up, but I encourage you to remind Samuel to stay until the end so he doesn\\u2019t miss important material or questions. If he missed answering some of the later questions, this is likely why.\\n\\nHis homework on adding mixed numbers was strong\\u2014he scored 92%. I encourage Samuel to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to reinforce his understanding. His stage test score was 87%, which shows he\\u2019s on the right track.\\n\\nFor extra practice, I recommend the supplemental problems in the workbook. If Samuel needs more, I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems. He\\u2019s also welcome to join my office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework or workbook help. Recordings are available if he can\\u2019t attend live.

I wanted to share an update on Travis's progress this week in our math class as we work through subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators.\\n\\nTravis demonstrated wonderful engagement and attentiveness during our lessons this week, and I appreciate his consistent participation. During our in-class practice, he answered 7 questions with 4 correct responses and 1 partially correct. He did encounter some challenges with questions 5 and 6, which is completely normal as he's mastering this new concept. I did notice that Travis left class about 4 minutes early, which meant he missed the end of our session. While I understand that sometimes things come up, I'd gently encourage you to help ensure he stays for the full 90 minutes whenever possible, as those closing minutes often contain important practice opportunities.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Travis scored an impressive 96% on the addition of mixed numbers assignment\\u2014that's excellent work! To further strengthen his understanding of these fraction concepts, I'd recommend having him review the homework solution video and correct any mistakes he made.\\n\\nAdditionally, Travis completed our stage test this week and scored 86%, which shows solid progress on the concepts from lessons 9 through 12.\\n\\nMoving forward, I'd suggest Travis explore the extra supplemental problems in the workbook to build even more confidence with these skills. He's also welcome to attend my office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, or if he'd benefit from more personalized support, he can book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per

Students in the US, Canada, and China can purchase physical gifts with their hard-earned coins during this time. Students outside these regions should still be able to purchase digital gifts, such as gift cards and e-books. The coin mall can be accessed through the parent app (tap your name, then the coins next to your student\\u2019s name) or through the student app (tap the student\\u2019s coins on the left). Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\nI wanted to share some feedback about Ruiyan\\u2019s progress this week. She did a wonderful job staying engaged and attentive during class, and I appreciate that she kept her camera on throughout our session. Ruiyan answered 8 questions in class, getting 5 correct and missing 2 (questions #7 and #8). She did not answer question #1, which may have been due to arriving a few minutes late. Ruiyan also had one brief disconnection during class, which we can work to minimize by troubleshooting any technical issues. If needed, please reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nRuiyan\\u2019s homework score was 92%, which is excellent. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to reinforce her understanding.

Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some updates on Quinn\\u2019s progress this week as we worked on subtraction of mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators. Quinn was very engaged and kept his camera on throughout the class, which really helped his focus. He answered 8 in-class questions, with 5 correct, 2 partially correct (questions #1 and #4), and 1 incorrect (#8). This shows he is grasping much of the material but could benefit from a bit more practice on some of the trickier problems.  \\n\\nQuinn missed about 2 minutes at the end of class, which might explain why he did not fully complete the last question. I understand things can come up, but I encourage you to help him remain in class for the full 90 minutes whenever possible to get the most out of the lesson.  \\n\\nRegarding homework on addition of mixed numbers, Quinn scored 32%. I highly recommend that he reviews the homework solution video and corrects his mistakes to solidify his understanding. Additionally, Quinn did well on the stage test covering lessons 9 through 12, with a score of 74%, which is a positive sign of his overall progress.  \\n\\nTo support Quinn further, he can work on extra problems in the supplemental workbook or request additional practice questions from me. I also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework or workbook help. If you feel Quinn could benefit from more personalized attention, please consider booking one of his free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Quinn\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JEyGeM.

I wanted to share some feedback on Andrea\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class, where we focused on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. Andrea participated actively and kept her camera on throughout the lesson, demonstrating good engagement and attentiveness.\\n\\nShe answered 8 questions during class, getting 5 correct, 1 partially correct (Question #1), 1 incorrect (Question #7), and left 1 unanswered (Question #8). It appears Andrea left the class 2 minutes early, which may explain the unanswered question. I understand that sometimes things come up, but if possible, please encourage Andrea to stay until the end of class to maximize her learning time.\\n\\nHer homework on adding mixed numbers was completed with an excellent score of 99%. I recommend that Andrea watch the homework solution video to review any small mistakes and reinforce her understanding. Additionally, she scored 100% on the recent stage test covering lessons 9 through 12, showing strong overall mastery.\\n\\nTo support Andrea\\u2019s continued growth, she can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide more practice if needed. Also, office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT offer a great opportunity for homework or workbook help, and recordings are available if she cannot attend live. If you feel Andrea would benefit from more personalized support, please consider booking one of her free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can view more detailed information on Andrea\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jp5lKd.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need additional resources.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 Jesmine\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0b Andrea \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u53cd\\u9988\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u7684\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u6d89\\u53ca\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002Andrea \\u8bfe\\u5802\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u79ef\\u6781\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u6253\\u5f00\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5ea6\\u548c\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e868\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d5\\u9898\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c1\\u9898\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c7\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u67091\\u9898\\u672a\\u56de\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c8\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002Andrea \\u63d0\\u524d\\u79bb\\u5f00\\u4e86\\u8bfe\\u58022\\u5206\\u949f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u5979\\u672a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u90a3\\u9053\\u9898\\u7684\\u539f\\u56e0\\u3002\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7279\\u6b8a\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5982\\u679c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u7684\\u8bdd\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u9f13\\u52b1 Andrea \\u575a\\u6301\\u4e0a\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u90e8\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5145\\u5206\\u5229\\u7528\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u662f\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u7684\\u52a0\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4f18\\u79c0\\uff0c\\u8fbe\\u5230\\u4e8699%\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae Andrea \\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u9898\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5c0f\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u8986\\u76d6\\u7b2c9\\u81f3\\u7b2c12\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\u4e2d\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u6ee1\\u5206100%\\uff0c\\u663e\\u793a\\u5979\\u6574\\u4f53\\u638c\\u63e1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u5f88\\u597d\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Andrea \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u9002\\u5408\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u5185\\u5bb9\\uff0c\\u4e14\\u5982\\u679c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5728\\u7ebf\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u89c2\\u770b\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97 Andrea \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4efd\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u67e5\\u770b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u5173\\u4e8e Andrea \\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jp5lKd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Maxwell has shown good engagement and attentiveness during this week\\u2019s lessons on subtracting mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators. He actively participated with his camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see. Out of eight in-class questions, Maxwell answered six correctly, was partially correct on question #1, and had difficulty with question #7. These specific questions may benefit from some review to strengthen his understanding.\\n\\nOne area we need to address is that Maxwell did not complete his homework on adding mixed numbers, which involved regrouping improper fractions. Completing this homework will be important for reinforcing concepts introduced in class and preparing for future lessons. I encourage Maxwell to complete this assignment as soon as possible and to submit future homework on time to support his progress.\\n\\nMaxwell\\u2019s stage test score was 63%, indicating there is room for improvement on the broader topics covered in recent lessons. To support him, we have extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.

I wanted to share an update on Lillian\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class, where we focused on subtracting mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators.\\n\\nLillian was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which I appreciate. She answered six in-class questions, correctly solving two and partially answering two others (#2 and #3). She did not answer questions #1 and #5, which likely relates to her arriving late and missing about 13 minutes of class. I understand that sometimes things come up, but I encourage your support to help her attend on time to fully benefit from the lesson. Lillian also experienced one brief disconnection, possibly during the break; if technical issues persist, please feel free to contact Think customer service for support.\\n\\nFor homework on addition of mixed numbers, Lillian scored 85%. I recommend that she watches the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes, which will reinforce her understanding. Additionally, Lillian performed excellently on the stage test, scoring a perfect 100%, showing strong grasp of the recent topics.\\n\\nTo support her further, I can provide extra supplemental problems from the workbook or additional practice upon request. We also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, ideal for homework or workbook help. If Lillian would benefit from more tailored support, please consider booking one of our up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can view more detailed information on Lillian\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JbWBXz.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Claire\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5Lillian\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u7684\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5305\\u62ec\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\n\\nLillian\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6295\\u5165\\u548c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5bf9\\u6b64\\u8868\\u793a\\u611f\\u8c22\\u3002\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86\\u516d\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d\\u4e24\\u9898\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u4e24\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c2\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u5979\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5f88\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u8fdf\\u5230\\u4e86\\uff0c\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u4e86\\u5927\\u7ea613\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u3002\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7a81\\u53d1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u80fd\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u51c6\\u65f6\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5145\\u5206\\u5229\\u7528\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002Lillian\\u8fd8\\u7ecf\\u5386\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u77ed\\u6682\\u7684\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u5728\\u4f11\\u606f\\u671f\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6301\\u7eed\\u51fa\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u6237\\u670d\\u52a1\\u5bfb\\u6c42\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u52a0\\u6cd5\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\uff0cLillian\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4e8685%\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5979\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0cLillian\\u5728\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u8bd5\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u51fa\\u8272\\uff0c\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u6ee1\\u5206100%\\uff0c\\u663e\\u793a\\u51fa\\u5bf9\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u7684\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u638c\\u63e1\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\uff0c\\u6211\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u6c42\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u901a\\u8fc7Think\\u5b66\\u751f\\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u5f00\\u653e\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u9002\\u5408\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679cLillian\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bLillian\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JbWBXz\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u7591\\u8651\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\n\\u656c\\u793c\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Kelsie,\\n\\nI hope this email finds you well! I wanted to reach out with some wonderful news about Thea's progress this week.\\n\\nThea has shown excellent engagement in class and demonstrated strong understanding of our lesson on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. She answered 6 out of 8 in-class questions correctly, which reflects solid comprehension of the material. She did find Question #4 partially challenging and left Question #8 unanswered, but these are great opportunities for us to focus on together.\\n\\nI'm particularly thrilled to share that Thea scored a perfect 100% on her stage test covering lessons 9 through 12! This is a fantastic achievement and shows she has mastered the concepts we've covered.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Thea scored 45% on the addition of mixed numbers assignment. I'd like to encourage her to watch the homework solution video and take time to correct her mistakes\\u2014this is one of the most valuable learning tools we have. Working through the solutions will help reinforce her understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Thea's continued growth, I'd recommend she explore the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, which provides additional practice with these concepts. I'm also available during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app if she'd like to discuss any homework or workbook questions. If she needs more intensive support, I can offer up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JeZBpP\\n\\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'm excited to see Thea continue building on her strong foundation!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher

Joyce has had a strong week in math class, particularly with the subtraction of mixed numbers involving borrowing from the whole number. She answered all 8 in-class questions correctly, demonstrating solid understanding and attentiveness throughout the lesson. Her engagement was excellent, and I appreciated that she kept her camera on consistently, which helped maintain a great classroom connection.  \\n\\nRegarding homework, Joyce scored 65% on the addition of mixed numbers with regrouping. I recommend encouraging her to watch the homework solution video carefully and revisit the problems where she made mistakes. This review will help solidify her grasp of regrouping improper fractions. For additional practice, Joyce can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request more problems tailored to her needs.  \\n\\nJoyce also completed the recent stage test covering lessons 9 through 12 with a score of 73%. This shows good progress, though there is room for growth, especially to boost her confidence and accuracy under test conditions.

I want to share an update on Eva\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math lessons focusing on the subtraction of mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators. Eva has been very engaged and attentive in class, with her camera consistently on, which helps her stay connected during lessons.  \\n\\nEva answered 8 in-class questions, correctly solving 6 and partially answering one (Question #4) while leaving one question (Question #7) unanswered. This shows she understands most of the material well but could benefit from some additional practice on the concepts related to those specific questions to build her confidence and accuracy.  \\n\\nHer homework on addition of mixed numbers, including regrouping improper fractions, was completed with an excellent score of 100%. I encourage Eva to watch the homework solution video to review and reinforce her understanding, especially to maintain this high level of accuracy. Additionally, she performed perfectly on the stage test covering lessons 9 through 12, demonstrating strong mastery of recent topics.  \\n\\nTo support Eva\\u2019s continued success, I recommend she try some extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, which can deepen her skills and prepare her for upcoming lessons. If you think Eva would benefit from more personalized help, please consider booking one of the three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available per semester through this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need additional resources.

Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Ling,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Isabel\\u2019s progress in our recent math lessons. This week, we focused on subtraction of mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from the whole number when needed. Isabel actively participated and remained engaged throughout, with her camera consistently on, which I appreciate.  \\n\\nIn class, Isabel answered 8 questions: she got 5 completely correct and 1 partially correct (question #4). She did not answer questions #7 and #8. I encourage her to attempt all questions fully to build confidence and apply her learning more comprehensively.  \\n\\nFor homework, Isabel scored a perfect 100% on addition of mixed numbers, showing strong understanding of that concept. It would be beneficial for her to watch the homework solution video to review any minor errors she might have made, reinforcing her skills.  \\n\\nAt the end of class, we had a stage test covering lessons 9 through 12, and Isabel earned 88%, demonstrating a solid grasp but with room for growth. To support her further, please remind her that extra practice problems are available in the supplemental workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems if needed.  \\n\\nAlso, I hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where Isabel can get help with homework and workbook questions. For more personalized support, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available this semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Isabel\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JYdzla.  \\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Jayden has shown good engagement and attentiveness in class this week as we worked through subtracting mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators. He kept his camera on consistently, which helped maintain focus during lessons. Jayden answered 8 in-class questions, with 4 correct, 2 partially correct (questions #4 and #5), 1 incorrect (#8), and 1 unanswered (#6). It appears that missing the last few minutes of class may have contributed to the unanswered question, so I gently encourage ensuring he can stay the full duration of the 90-minute sessions whenever possible.\\n\\nJayden\\u2019s stage test score was a solid 87%, indicating a good understanding of the material from lessons 9 through 12. However, he did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on adding mixed numbers, which is important practice to reinforce the concepts. Encouraging Jayden to complete homework on time will support his progress and confidence.\\n\\nIf Jayden would like extra practice, supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request. Additionally, I hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help, and class recordings are accessible for review.

I would also love to answer any questions you may have for me. Please schedule a 15-minute parent-teacher phone call with me here. Note that these calls will be in English only, as I am still learning Mandarin!\\n\\nIf you would prefer, you can answer these intake questions via a form linked here: https://forms.gle/citeKWa84UNa2WXb7. The form is written in English and Mandarin Chinese, and can take answers in both languages. Note that you do not need to complete the form AND schedule a phone call unless you\\u2019d prefer to do so. The questions on the form are the same ones I will ask during the call.\\n\\n2) My Contact Info\\n\\nYou can reach me via 3 modes of contact:\\n\\nEmail: omar.shohoud@thethinkacademy.com  \\nThink Parent app: Message me directly  \\nPhone Call/SMS/WeChat/Whatsapp: +14254457108  \\n\\nYou may receive text messages from a different number which I use to send out mass texts, but you should use one of the methods above to contact me. Feel free to reach out anytime! Talk soon!\\n\\n---\\n\\nEnglish:\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI am delighted to welcome Maria to our Grade 4 Honors class! This week, we focused on subtraction of mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from the whole number when needed. Maria was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nIn class, Maria answered six questions. She answered two correctly and one partially correctly (Question #1), but she left three questions unanswered (#2, #5, and #6). This suggests she is still building confidence or familiarity with some of the material, especially on those unanswered questions. During the short stage test covering lessons 9 through 12, Maria scored 61%, indicating room for improvement in applying these concepts independently.\\n\\nTo support her progress, I recommend that Maria practices extra problems from the supplemental workbook, which can reinforce these skills. I am also happy to provide additional problems upon request. Please encourage her to attend our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework and workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if she cannot attend live.\\n\\nAdditionally, Maria is eligible for up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester. These personalized sessions can target specific challenges she might have. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about Maria\\u2019s performance, please refer to the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5GpE.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if I can support Maria\\u2019s learning in any other way. I look forward to working closely with you both throughout the year.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u6b22\\u8fceMaria\\u52a0\\u5165\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u56db\\u5e74\\u7ea7\\u8363\\u8a89\\u73ed\\uff01\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5e26\\u6709\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u7684\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5305\\u62ec\\u5f53\\u5206\\u6570\\u90e8\\u5206\\u4e0d\\u8db3\\u4ee5\\u51cf\\u53bb\\u65f6\\u5982\\u4f55\\u4ece\\u6574\\u6570\\u90e8\\u5206\\u501f\\u4f4d\\u3002Maria\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u5f88\\u6b23\\u6170\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0cMaria\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e866\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d2\\u4e2a\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c1\\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u67093\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c2\\u9898\\u3001\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c6\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5728\\u67d0\\u4e9b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u4e0a\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u8fd8\\u9700\\u8981\\u589e\\u52a0\\u81ea\\u4fe1\\u6216\\u719f\\u6089\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u7279\\u522b\\u662f\\u90a3\\u4e9b\\u672a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5728\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u7b2c9\\u81f312\\u8bfe\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u7684\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u8bd5\\u4e2d\\uff0cMaria\\u5f97\\u520661%\\uff0c\\u663e\\u793a\\u5979\\u5728\\u72ec\\u7acb\\u8fd0\\u7528\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u65f6\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u63d0\\u5347\\u7a7a\\u95f4\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeMaria\\u591a\\u505a\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u4e66\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u8bf7\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think\\u5b66\\u751f\\u7aef\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u90a3\\u91cc\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u4e66\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u5236\\u89c6\\u9891\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u56de\\u770b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0cMaria\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u67093\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u5979\\u7684\\u5177\\u4f53\\u56f0\\u96be\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u3002\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u60f3\\u4e86\\u89e3Maria\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u67e5\\u770b\\u6b64\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5GpE\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u4e3aMaria\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\u671f\\u5f85\\u5728\\u63a5\\u4e0b\\u6765\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5e74\\u91cc\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u548cMaria\\u5bc6\\u5207\\u5408\\u4f5c\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Students in the US, Canada, and China can purchase physical gifts with their hard-earned coins during this time.

Let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Xuying,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Alina\\u2019s progress in our recent lessons on subtraction of mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators. Alina has been engaged and attentive during class, keeping her camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nDuring this week\\u2019s lesson, Alina answered eight in-class questions, with three correct, two partially correct (on questions #1 and #4), one incorrect (question #8), and two unanswered (#5 and #6). She also missed about 9 minutes due to two brief disconnections, one possibly related to the break. To help her benefit fully from class, please ensure she has a stable connection; if needed, Think customer service can assist with technical issues.\\n\\nHer recent homework on addition of mixed numbers scored 77%. I encourage Alina to watch the homework solution video and revisit any mistakes to strengthen her understanding. Additionally, her stage test score was 60%, indicating some difficulty consolidating the recent topics, which is understandable given their complexity.\\n\\nTo support Alina further, she can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice questions. I also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for any homework or workbook help. For more personalized assistance, please consider booking one of her three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can review more detailed information on Alina\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ8g0.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support in Alina\\u2019s learning journey. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5f90\\u82f1\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u963f\\u4e3d\\u5a1c\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff08\\u5305\\u62ec\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff09\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u963f\\u4e3d\\u5a1c\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u4e5f\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0c\\u963f\\u4e3d\\u5a1c\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e868\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d3\\u9898\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c2\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c4\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c1\\u9898\\u7b54\\u9519\\uff08\\u7b2c8\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u67092\\u9898\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c6\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u5979\\u56e0\\u4e24\\u6b21\\u77ed\\u6682\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff08\\u5176\\u4e2d\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u4f11\\u606f\\u65f6\\u53d1\\u751f\\uff09\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u7ea69\\u5206\\u949f\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u5979\\u80fd\\u5145\\u5206\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u8bfe\\u5802\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u60a8\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u7a33\\u5b9a\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0cThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6280\\u672f\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5979\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u662f\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u52a0\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a77%\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u963f\\u4e3d\\u5a1c\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u7684\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a60%\\uff0c\\u8bf4\\u660e\\u5979\\u5728\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u65f6\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u4e00\\u5b9a\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5728\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u96be\\u5ea6\\u8f83\\u5927\\u7684\\u4e3b\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u662f\\u6b63\\u5e38\\u7684\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301\\u963f\\u4e3d\\u5a1c\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u5411\\u6211\\u8bf7\\u6c42\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think\\u5b66\\u751f\\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u4e0a\\u5f00\\u653e\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u5979\\u6765\\u5bfb\\u6c42\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u5979\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u963f\\u4e3d\\u5a1c\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ8g0\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u5bf9\\u963f\\u4e3d\\u5a1c\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8877\\u5fc3\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",
