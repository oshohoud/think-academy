    "- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on Think Student app (homework and workbook help)\n",

    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. Address the parent by name (use \"Parent\" if no name provided)\n",
    "2. Use the student's correct pronouns throughout\n",
    "3. Mention the specific in-class question numbers that the student struggled with (available in report).\n",
    "4. Do not mention the specific areas that the in-class questions covered, beyond the general subject matter covered in the lesson. That information is not available to you.\n",
    "5. There is no need to mention detailed attendance data (e.g. how many minutes the student did or did not attend) if the student attended the entire lesson or was entirely absent.\n",
    "6. If the student was partially absent, describe attendance data in minutes, not percentages. Since the full class time is 90 minutes, you would say to the parent of a child who missed 10% of the class that the child \"missed 9 minutes of class\". Round to the nearest minute.\n",
    "7. Unless otherwise specified in the above instructions, mention and comment on the student's homework score (as a percentage). If the student did not complete the homework, say they did not complete it and encourage them to complete it. Do not provide feedback about specific questions on the homework, since that information is not available to you\n",
    "8. Provide actionable recommendations based on the data\n",
    "9. If student was absent, focus on homework feedback and offer catch-up resources\n",
    "10. If provided above, include the in-class report link at the end of the email and mention to the parent they can find more detailed performance information in it.\n",
    "11. Be encouraging but honest about areas needing improvement\n",
    "12. Include relevant resources based on student's needs. If recommending 1-on-1 tutoring, include the tutoring link in the email.\n",
    "13. Keep tone warm, professional, and personalized\n",
    "14. Keep the feedback part (not including extra section) between 200-300 words.\n",
    "15. Do NOT use generic template language\n",
    "16. Do NOT include a subject at the top of the email body\n",
    "17. Do NOT use asterisks ** to indicate bold, this is for markdown and does not work for plain text.\n",
    "18. After the English email, write the exact same email translated into Mandarin Chinese.\n",

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. Here is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI wanted to let you know that Leo was absent from this week\\u2019s class on improper fractions, mixed numbers, and fraction simplification. I did not receive advance notice about his absence; if your schedule has changed or if you need to transfer or reschedule class times, please let me know\\u2014we\\u2019re happy to help make arrangements to support Leo\\u2019s learning.\\n\\nLeo\\u2019s homework score from last week was 79%. This is a solid effort, and I appreciate his work on the rotation and symmetry topics. To keep progressing, I encourage Leo to review his past homework and try the extra supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice. If he has questions, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great resource, and the class recordings are always available if he is unable to attend live.\\n\\nTo help Leo catch up on this week\\u2019s missed lesson, I recommend that he watch the recording and attempt the related workbook problems. If he would benefit from more individualized support, we offer up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester; you can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need help accessing any of these resources or if you have questions about Leo\\u2019s progress. I look forward to supporting him as he continues to learn and grow.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher

The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share feedback on Siyan\\u2019s progress in math this week. We explored improper fractions and mixed numbers, focusing on how to use visual models, mark them on number lines, and simplify fractions. Siyan was engaged and attentive in class, with her camera consistently on, which helped her participate actively in discussions.\\n\\nDuring in-class work, Siyan answered 11 questions, with 6 correct responses and 1 partially correct. She struggled with questions 9 and 11, and gave a partial answer on question 7. There were also two questions left unanswered (6 and 10). Reviewing these particular questions with her would help strengthen her understanding and confidence in this new material.\\n\\nOn last week\\u2019s homework, Siyan scored an impressive 97%. This shows she is absorbing foundational concepts well, especially in geometry topics such as rotations and symmetry. To build on this, I recommend Siyan completes the stage test before her next lesson, as it will reinforce these skills and help us track her mastery.\\n\\nFor extra practice, Siyan can use the supplemental workbook, which contains additional fraction problems. More targeted practice is available upon request, and she is always welcome at our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app. Recordings of all lessons and office hours are available if she cannot attend live. For more personalized support, you may book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. With a bit more focused review on the questions she found challenging, I am confident Siyan will continue to grow in her mathematical thinking. You can find more detailed information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB513e.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher

Wilson was engaged and attentive throughout class and kept his camera on consistently, which helped foster a collaborative learning environment.\\n\\nWilson answered 9 out of 11 in-class questions correctly, which shows a strong grasp of the new material. There was just one question he answered incorrectly (#7) and one he did not answer (#6). I encourage Wilson to review these specific items in the class report to be sure he fully understands all aspects of the topic. His high level of participation is commendable, and I appreciate his focus during the lesson.\\n\\nLast week\\u2019s homework (on rotations and symmetry) was completed with a score of 92%, reflecting careful effort and understanding. Great job, Wilson!\\n\\nTo keep building his confidence and skills, I recommend that Wilson:\\n- Review class recordings, especially sections related to improper fractions and mixed numbers.\\n- Try the extra supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice.\\n- Attend our weekly office hours (Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT) for targeted help with classwork or homework.\\n- If he would benefit from more personalized attention, please take advantage of up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester. You can book these at: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nAs always, more detailed performance information is available in the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/94xVYw.\\n\\nThank you for your support at home. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there are specific areas you\\u2019d like Wilson to focus on further.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher

She also did not answer questions #6 and #8. I encourage her to review the related lesson materials and practice with extra problems in the supplemental workbook to reinforce these concepts. If she has lingering questions, attending our office hours on Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT or booking one of our free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions (https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/) could provide valuable support.\\n\\nStephanie missed 5 minutes of class time due to a disconnection. If technical issues persist, please consider reaching out to Think customer service for assistance to ensure continuous participation.\\n\\nHer previous homework score was excellent at 92%. This strong performance is a testament to her effort and understanding of the rotation concepts covered last week.\\n\\nAs always, additional practice problems are available upon request, and class recordings can be found in the student app if a review is needed.

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\n  Fall-Spring Curriculum Continuity \\n\\n    - The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n\\n    - Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\n  Math Kangaroo (MK) Preparation \\n\\n    - For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n\\n    - Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n\\n    - Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\n  Spring Registration Timeline \\n\\n    - As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n\\n    - Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n\\n    - Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n\\n    - The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n\\n    - Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Dominic demonstrated strong engagement and kept his camera on throughout our lesson on improper fractions, mixed numbers, and fraction simplification. Out of 11 in-class questions, he answered 8, with 5 fully correct and 3 partially correct (questions #3, #7, and #8). While Dominic did not attempt questions #1, #6, and #10, he was attentive and participated well in class activities.\\n\\nDominic\\u2019s previous homework score was 62%. I recommend he reviews the feedback and revisits any concepts he found challenging, especially as these foundational skills will support future topics. Completing the stage test before the next lesson will also help reinforce his understanding.\\n\\nTo further strengthen his skills, Dominic can make use of the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, request additional practice problems, or join our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for targeted support. For more personalized help, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available per semester at https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease encourage Dominic to attempt all questions in future lessons, as this will build confidence and mastery. More detailed information about his in-class performance can be found in his report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWjda\\n\\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss Dominic\\u2019s progress, please feel free to reach out.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u91cd\\u8981\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u8bf7\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u8282\\u8bfe\\u524d\\u8ba9Dominic\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\u3002\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\u5728\\u5b66\\u751fApp\\u7684\\u7b2c\\u516b\\u8bfe\\u4e0b\\u65b9\\u53ef\\u627e\\u5230\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u5bb6\\u957f\\u4f1a\\u4e0a\\u6240\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u4e3b\\u9898\\u7684\\u6458\\u8981\\u3002\\u5f55\\u97f3\\u548c\\u8bfe\\u4ef6\\u53ef\\u5728\\u5b66\\u751fApp\\u7684\\u7b2c\\u516b\\u8bfe\\u6a21\\u5757\\u4e2d\\u83b7\\u53d6\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u4ef6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u7b14\\u8bb0\\u7684\\u6700\\u540e\\u3002\\n\\n  \\u79cb\\u6625\\u5b66\\u5e74\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u8854\\u63a5 \\n\\n    -

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nThis week, Charlotte worked on understanding improper fractions and mixed numbers, including representing them visually and marking them on a number line. She was attentive and consistently engaged during class, and kept her camera on throughout the lesson\\u2014this helped her stay connected with our activities.\\n\\nCharlotte answered 11 in-class questions, with 3 correct, 1 partially correct, 4 incorrect (questions #3, #5, #8, #11), and 3 unanswered (questions #1, #6, #10). I appreciate her willingness to participate and encourage her to review the questions she found challenging\\u2014especially those she left blank or was incorrect on. Reviewing these problems will help reinforce her understanding of this week\\u2019s concepts.\\n\\nCharlotte did not complete her homework from last week, which covered rotations and rotational symmetry. Please encourage her to finish this assignment, as homework is designed to reinforce class material and build foundational skills for future lessons. Completing homework on time will help her stay on track and deepen her confidence in new topics.\\n\\nFor extra support, Charlotte can use the supplemental problems in the workbook, request additional practice problems, or attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for help with homework and workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if she cannot join live. She also has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester\\u2014here is the booking link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RqYAdd.\\n\\nAs always, I am here to support Charlotte\\u2019s growth and look forward to seeing her progress in upcoming lessons.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. Here is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support of Eva\\u2019s learning. This week, we introduced improper fractions and mixed numbers, focusing on representing them visually, marking them on number lines, and simplifying fractions. Eva attended 88 minutes of our 90-minute class but arrived late, which likely contributed to her not answering the first several questions. She was engaged and attentive throughout the class, and consistently kept her camera on, which I appreciate.\\n\\nEva answered 11 in-class questions, with 2 correct, 2 incorrect (questions #5 and #11), and 7 unanswered (questions #1, #2, #3, #6, #7, #8, and #10). Her late arrival and a disconnection during class may have impacted her ability to respond to all questions. I encourage you to help Eva arrive promptly and ensure a stable internet connection for future sessions. For technical support, please feel free to reach out to Think customer service.\\n\\nI noticed that Eva did not complete her homework from last week. Please encourage her to finish it, as regular homework practice is essential for her progress. Timely completion will help reinforce the concepts we cover in class.\\n\\nTo support Eva\\u2019s learning, I recommend she reviews the lesson recording and uses extra supplemental problems in the workbook. She may also benefit from attending our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for help with homework or class material. Additionally, you can book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester for Eva if additional support would be helpful: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can review Eva\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZAgX.\\n\\nThank you for partnering with me to support Eva\\u2019s growth. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further resources.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nDear Lin,\\n\\nThis week, Yifeng made strong progress as we introduced improper fractions and mixed numbers. He was attentive and engaged throughout the lesson, participating actively and keeping his camera on the whole time, which helped foster a positive classroom environment.\\n\\nYifeng answered 11 in-class questions, with 8 correct and 1 partially correct (question #7). There were no incorrect answers, but he did not respond to questions #6 and #10. I encourage Yifeng to review these missed questions using the class recording or supplementary workbook, as this will help reinforce his understanding and boost his confidence for future lessons.\\n\\nYifeng attended 81 out of 90 minutes of class due to a brief disconnection. To minimize future disruptions, please ensure a stable internet connection for class time. If you encounter technical difficulties, Think customer service is available to assist.\\n\\nLast week's homework score was 62%. As we build on these foundational concepts, I recommend that Yifeng make use of the extra supplemental problems in the workbook and attend our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for additional support. Recordings of the class and office hours are also available in the app. If Yifeng would benefit from targeted guidance, you may book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester at the following link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vAm1gX.\\n\\nThank you for your continued partnership in supporting Yifeng\\u2019s learning. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything further I can do to help him succeed.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI wanted to share some feedback on Tyler\\u2019s progress with this week\\u2019s lesson on improper fractions and mixed numbers. Tyler was engaged and attentive throughout class, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on and participated actively.\\n\\nOn the in-class questions, Tyler answered 11 in total. He found several of them challenging\\u2014he did not answer 6 of the questions, and was unable to answer questions #4, #5, #9, and #11 correctly. He was partially correct on question #1. I encourage Tyler to review these specific questions in the in-class report, which may help him see where he got stuck and how to approach similar problems in the future.\\n\\nWhile in-class performance this week was difficult, I am pleased to see Tyler\\u2019s strong homework performance last week, with a score of 90%. This shows he is capable of mastering new material with practice.\\n\\nTo support Tyler\\u2019s progress, I recommend:\\n- Reviewing the supplemental workbook for extra practice on fractions and mixed numbers\\n- Attending office hours on Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT for individualized support\\n- Taking advantage of up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester (book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/)\\n- Replaying the class recording for a step-by-step walkthrough of key examples\\n\\nIf you would like more detailed information, the in-class report is available here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97MV1o.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support at home. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like additional practice resources for Tyler.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Audrey was introduced to improper fractions and mixed numbers, including how to use visual models, work with number lines, and simplify fractions. Audrey answered 11 in-class questions, with 4 correct, 2 partially correct (questions 7 and 10), and 1 incorrect (question 11). There were 4 questions left unanswered (questions 1, 6, 8, and 9). I noticed she was fully engaged during class discussions and consistently kept her camera on, which was wonderful to see.\\n\\nAudrey attended 62 minutes out of the 90-minute class, missing 28 minutes due to a disconnection. To help her get the most out of our lessons, please try to ensure a stable internet connection for her next class. If you encounter any technical issues, Think customer service is available to help troubleshoot.\\n\\nAudrey\\u2019s homework score from last week was 79%. This shows solid understanding, but there is room for further growth, especially as concepts will continue to build in complexity. I encourage her to review the challenging in-class questions and complete the stage test before our next lesson.\\n\\nTo support Audrey\\u2019s learning, please remind her to use the extra supplemental problems in the workbook and reach out if she would like additional practice problems. I am available during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. If Audrey would benefit from more personalized support, you are welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester using this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/voGAmY.\\n\\nThank you for your partnership and support. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything more I can do to help Audrey succeed.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share an update on Julia\\u2019s progress in math this week as we explored improper fractions and mixed numbers, including their representation with visual models and on number lines, as well as simplifying fractions.\\n\\nJulia participated with great focus and kept her camera on throughout class, which contributed positively to our discussions. She answered 9 questions during class, with 2 answered correctly and 4 partially correct. The partially correct responses were on questions 3, 5, 6, and 8, showing that Julia is making progress but would benefit from some extra practice to solidify her understanding. There were also a few questions\\u2014specifically numbers 1, 4, and 9\\u2014that Julia didn\\u2019t answer. I encourage her to review these in particular, as revisiting them can help build her confidence and skills.\\n\\nI also noticed that Julia did not submit last week\\u2019s homework on rotations and rotational symmetry. Please remind her to complete this as soon as possible, as timely homework completion is essential for reinforcing new concepts.\\n\\nTo support Julia further, I recommend she try extra supplemental problems in the workbook, or reach out to me during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for additional help. We also offer up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions each semester\\u2014these can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Class recordings and extra problems are available if she needs more practice.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Julia\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9V6rdG.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support at home. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can help Julia in any way.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. Here is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n    - The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n\\n    - Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n    - For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n\\n    - Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n\\n    - Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n    - As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n\\n    - Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n\\n    - Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n\\n    - The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n\\n    - Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI hope you are having a wonderful week! I wanted to share an update on Zack\\u2019s progress in our recent lesson on improper fractions and mixed numbers, including representing them visually, marking them on a number line, and simplifying fractions.\\n\\nZack participated actively in class and kept his camera on throughout, which helped foster a positive learning environment. Out of 11 in-class questions, he answered 4 correctly and 1 partially correctly. Zack struggled with questions #4, #8, and #11, and left questions #2, #6, and #10 unanswered. He was present for 80 out of the 90 minutes, leaving class early; this may have contributed to the missed questions toward the end. There were also two disconnections, so I encourage you to check your internet setup or contact Think customer service if you need technical support to ensure Zack can participate fully in future classes.\\n\\nHis engagement and attentiveness are commendable, and I encourage Zack to continue asking questions and making use of our resources. Last week, Zack scored 68% on homework about rotations and rotational symmetry. With a bit more practice, I\\u2019m confident he will strengthen his understanding.\\n\\nFor improvement, please make sure Zack attends the full class and completes the stage test before our next lesson. He can also review class recordings, use supplemental workbook problems, and attend Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT for extra help. If you feel Zack would benefit from additional support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RNl7Kl.\\n\\nThank you for your support! Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can do to help Zack succeed.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Kiki\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u91cd\\u8981\\u63d0\\u793a\\uff1a\\u8bf7\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u8282\\u8bfe\\u524d\\u8ba9Zack\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\uff0c\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\u53ef\\u5728\\u5b66\\u751fApp\\u7b2c8\\u8bfe\\u4e0b\\u65b9\\u627e\\u5230\\u3002\\u5bb6\\u957f\\u4f1a\\u4e0a\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u7684\\u4e3b\\u9898\\u5df2\\u6574\\u7406\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff0c\\u4f1a\\u8bae\\u5f55\\u97f3\\u548c\\u8bfe\\u4ef6\\u53ef\\u5728\\u5b66\\u751fApp\\u7b2c8\\u8bfe\\u6a21\\u5757\\u5185\\u83b7\\u53d6\\u2014\\u2014\\u8bfe\\u4ef6\\u53ef\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u7b14\\u8bb0\\u672b\\u5c3e\\u627e\\u5230\\u3002\\n\\n\\u79cb\\u6625\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u8854\\u63a5\\n\\n    -

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.  \\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity  \\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.  \\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation  \\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.  \\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.  \\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline  \\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.  \\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.  \\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.  \\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.  \\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Ethan\\u2019s progress this week as we began our unit on improper fractions and mixed numbers. Ethan was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, consistently keeping his camera on and participating actively in class discussions. Out of 11 in-class questions, he answered 7 correctly and showed partial understanding on 2 more. He struggled with question 9 and left question 6 unanswered, while questions 7 and 10 were partially correct. I encourage Ethan to review these specific in-class questions, as revisiting them will help solidify his understanding of the new concepts.\\n\\nEthan\\u2019s homework score from last week was 88%, which reflects his strong grasp of rotations and symmetry. To further support his learning, I recommend that Ethan try some extra supplemental problems from the workbook, especially on mixed numbers and improper fractions. If he would benefit from more personalized support, we offer up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions each semester (book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/). Additionally, office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings are accessible if he cannot attend live.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or would like additional practice problems for Ethan. You can also find more detailed information on Ethan's performance in the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9LnKY6\\n\\nThank you for your continued partnership and support!\\n\\nBest

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Emily worked on improper fractions and mixed numbers, focusing on visual modeling, identifying these numbers on a number line, and fraction simplification. I want to celebrate how engaged and attentive she was throughout class\\u2014she kept her camera on and participated actively in discussions.\\n\\nEmily completed 11 in-class questions, answering 9 correctly. She left Question #6 unanswered and struggled with Question #11. These are great opportunities for her to review and reinforce her understanding. Her consistent engagement is commendable and really helps her learning.\\n\\nFor last week\\u2019s homework on shape rotations and rotational symmetry, Emily achieved a perfect score of 100%, showing strong mastery of those concepts.\\n\\nTo help Emily continue progressing, I recommend:\\n- Reviewing mistakes from class, especially the questions she missed or left blank.\\n- Practicing extra supplemental problems from the workbook for additional support.\\n- Making use of office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for help with homework or workbook problems.\\n- If she would benefit from more individualized support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available each semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nRecordings of classes and office hours are also available in the Student app for review. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like specific practice problems.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in Emily\\u2019s in-class report here:

I wanted to take a moment to discuss Jericho's progress in our math class. This week, we covered the introduction to improper fractions and mixed numbers, focusing on visual models and number line representations.\\n\\nIn class, Jericho answered a total of 11 questions, with 8 correct, 1 partially correct, and 1 incorrect. He didn't answer one question. The questions he struggled with were #11 and #7, which were partially correct. Jericho was engaged and attentive during the lesson, but he missed 6 minutes of class due to disconnections. Encouraging him to ensure continuous attendance and troubleshooting any technical issues would be beneficial. If needed, you can reach out to Think customer service for assistance.\\n\\nFor homework, Jericho scored 72% on the previous assignment about rotations of shapes. I encourage him to review and practice these concepts further using the supplemental workbook or additional problems available upon request.\\n\\nActionable steps for Jericho include completing the stage test before the next lesson, available in the Student app below lesson 8. He can also benefit from attending office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for further support.\\n\\nIf you feel Jericho needs more individualized help, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available for review.\\n\\nPlease find more detailed performance information in Jericho's in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMnkl.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and I look forward to seeing Jericho's progress.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nImportant: Please have Jericho complete the stage test before the next lesson. It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity:\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation:\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline:\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. Here is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Yilia worked on improper fractions and mixed numbers\\u2014how to represent them with visual models, mark and identify them on a number line, and simplify fractions. She was engaged and attentive throughout class, with her camera consistently on, and answered 11 in-class questions. Out of these, she answered 5 correctly, 3 partially correct, 2 incorrectly (questions #9 and #11), and did not answer question #6.\\n\\nYilia\\u2019s effort to participate actively is commendable, and her willingness to attempt every question shows persistence. To further strengthen her understanding, I recommend reviewing the strategies we practiced for distinguishing improper fractions and mixed numbers, especially using number lines. Practicing extra problems in the supplemental workbook (distinct from the textbook) will be very helpful. If Yilia would like more targeted support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available each semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nOn last week\\u2019s homework, Yilia scored 42%. Continued practice with rotations and symmetry will help her solidify these foundational skills. She is welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM for extra help, and additional problems are available upon request. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if she cannot join live.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can find Yilia\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5OqG.\\n\\nThank you for your ongoing support.

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Nathan explored how to work with improper fractions and mixed numbers, including using visual models and number lines, and strategies for simplifying fractions. Nathan was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and kept his camera on, which helped foster a positive learning environment.\\n\\nHe answered 11 in-class questions, with 7 fully correct, 1 partially correct (question #10), and 1 incorrect (question #11). There were also 2 questions left unanswered (#6 and #7). These specific questions are worth revisiting to build more confidence in the current topics. Nathan\\u2019s participation is commendable, but reviewing these missed or partially completed questions will help him solidify his understanding.\\n\\nNathan attended 86 out of 90 minutes of class and experienced 2 disconnections. Please help Nathan troubleshoot any technical issues to maximize his attendance, and feel free to reach out to Think customer service if you need additional support.\\n\\nNathan scored 92% on last week\\u2019s homework about rotations and symmetry, which demonstrates his strong grasp of those concepts.\\n\\nFor extra practice, Nathan can use the supplemental problems in his workbook or request additional problems. Office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT through the Think Student app, and class recordings can be replayed at any time. If Nathan would benefit from more targeted help, you can book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester at https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in Nathan\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDX1mK\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please reach out if you have any questions or if Nathan needs additional resources.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nDear Jing,\\n\\nThis week, Alena explored improper fractions and mixed numbers in class, including representing them with visual models, placing them on a number line, and simplifying fractions. She was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and I appreciate that she kept her camera on consistently.\\n\\nAlena answered 4 out of 11 in-class questions correctly. She did not answer questions #1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, or 10, and I noticed she arrived late and experienced two disconnections during class, which likely contributed to the missed questions. She attended 88 out of 90 minutes. Please help Alena log in a few minutes early next week and check her internet connection before class. If technical issues persist, Think customer service is available to assist.\\n\\nHer homework score from last week was 88%, which shows solid understanding of rotations and symmetry topics. This is a strong foundation, and I encourage her to keep up the effort on assignments.\\n\\nTo further reinforce Alena\\u2019s learning, I recommend reviewing the class recording together and practicing extra problems from the supplemental workbook. Additional practice problems are available upon request. Alena is also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for extra help, and up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl4agD\\n\\nThank you for your continued partnership. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything further I can do to support Alena.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Olivia worked on improper fractions and mixed numbers, focusing on representing them visually, placing them on a number line, and simplifying fractions. Olivia was consistently engaged and attentive, and she always kept her camera on, which helps foster a positive classroom atmosphere.\\n\\nIn class, Olivia answered 9 questions, with 2 fully correct, 1 partially correct, and 3 incorrect (specifically on questions #4, #8, and #9). She left 3 questions unanswered (#3, #6, and #7). While she showed effort and engagement, these results suggest that Olivia could benefit from additional practice to build her confidence and accuracy with these new concepts.\\n\\nOn her most recent homework (covering rotations and symmetry), Olivia achieved an excellent score of 96%. This demonstrates her strong understanding of prior material and her ability to apply those skills independently.\\n\\nFor the new topics, I recommend that Olivia review the lesson recording and try the extra supplemental problems in the workbook for more targeted practice. If she would like more support, office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are offered each semester (book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/). Additional practice problems are also available upon request.\\n\\nThank you for your support at home. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you would like further resources for Olivia.

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis week, Sitara made excellent progress as we explored improper fractions and mixed numbers, including working with visual models and number lines. I was especially pleased with how engaged and attentive she was throughout the lesson, and she kept her camera on the entire time, which helps foster a sense of classroom community.\\n\\nSitara answered 9 in-class questions, with 7 answered correctly, 1 partially correct (question #3), and only 1 incorrect (question #6). This demonstrates a strong understanding of our new concepts. For the partially correct and incorrect questions, I recommend that Sitara revisit those problems to reinforce her grasp of the material. If she has questions or needs clarification, our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT are a great resource, and she is always welcome to bring specific problems for discussion.\\n\\nSitara attended 88 out of 90 minutes of class. I noticed she had one brief disconnection. For future sessions, I recommend checking your internet connection before class to help her get the most out of every lesson. If you encounter ongoing technical issues, please feel free to reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nHer homework score from last week was an outstanding 99%. This consistent effort is truly commendable.\\n\\nTo further support her learning, Sitara can use extra supplemental problems from the workbook (distinct from the textbook), or request additional practice as needed. Recordings of classes and office hours are always available in the app. Additionally, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available each semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details about Sitara\\u2019s in-class work, you can review her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JmeMDd\\n\\nThank you for your ongoing support. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if Sitara would benefit from extra resources.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. Here is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI wanted to share some feedback on Iris\\u2019s progress this week. During our lesson on improper fractions and mixed numbers, Iris was engaged and attentive\\u2014she consistently had her camera on and participated positively in class discussions. Out of the 9 in-class questions, Iris answered 6 correctly. She showed determination, even when the material was challenging. The questions Iris struggled with were #5, #6, and #9. I encourage her to review these problems to strengthen her understanding.\\n\\nIris\\u2019s homework from last week was outstanding\\u2014she scored 100%! This is a strong indication of her mastery of the previous topic on rotations and symmetry.\\n\\nTo help Iris continue building her confidence with improper fractions and mixed numbers, I recommend she try a few extra practice problems from the supplemental workbook this week. If she\\u2019d like additional support, my office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM on the Think Student app, and recordings are always available if she can\\u2019t join live. Iris is also eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester; you can book these at https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019d like more detailed information about Iris\\u2019s in-class performance, you can find her full report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xVZ5.\\n\\nThank you for your partnership and support. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like specific recommendations for Iris.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. Here is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\n  Fall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n    - The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n    - Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\n  Math Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n    - For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n    - Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n    - Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\n  Spring Registration Timeline\\n\\n    - As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n    - Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n    - Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n    - The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n    - Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI\\u2019m happy to share Sophia\\u2019s progress from this week\\u2019s lesson on improper fractions and mixed numbers. Sophia was engaged and attentive throughout class, consistently keeping her camera on and participating thoughtfully.\\n\\nThis week, Sophia answered 7 in-class questions, with 4 correct and 2 partially correct responses. She found Question 6 challenging and provided partial answers for Questions 2 and 4. I encourage Sophia to review these questions, as reinforcing these concepts will help solidify her understanding as we move forward. She is progressing well, and her engagement is a real asset to her learning.\\n\\nRegarding homework from last week on rotations and rotational symmetry, Sophia scored 19%. I recommend reviewing the homework together to address any confusion. She is welcome to use the extra supplemental problems in her workbook for more practice, and I also encourage her to attend office hours on Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT in the Think Student app for additional support. For targeted assistance, Sophia may book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester at https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nRecordings of all lessons and office hours are also available if Sophia would like to review any material. More detailed information about Sophia\\u2019s in-class performance can be found in her report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JwoAYQ.\\n\\nThank you for your partnership and support. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss Sophia\\u2019s progress further.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u91cd\\u8981\\u63d0\\u793a\\uff1a\\u8bf7\\u60a8\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u8282\\u8bfe\\u524d\\u5e2e\\u52a9Sophia\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\u3002\\u6d4b\\u9a8c\\u53ef\\u5728\\u5b66\\u751fApp\\u4e2d\\u7b2c8\\u8bfe\\u4e0b\\u65b9\\u627e\\u5230\\u3002\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u5bb6\\u957f\\u4f1a\\u6240\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u7684\\u6982\\u8981\\u3002\\u4f1a\\u8bae\\u5f55\\u97f3\\u548c\\u8bfe\\u4ef6\\u53ef\\u5728\\u5b66\\u751fApp\\u7684\\u7b2c8\\u8bfe\\u6a21\\u5757\\u4e2d\\u67e5\\u770b\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u4ef6\\u53ef\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u7b14\\u8bb0\\u672b\\u5c3e\\u627e\\u5230\\u3002\\n\\n  \\u79cb-\\u6625\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u8854\\u63a5\\n\\n    -

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.  \\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis week, Zoe worked on improper fractions and mixed numbers\\u2014learning to represent them with visual models, place them on number lines, and simplify fractions. I was very pleased to see her engaged and attentive in class, with her camera consistently on and participating throughout our activities.\\n\\nZoe answered 9 in-class questions: she got 5 correct, 1 partially correct (Question 1), 1 incorrect (Question 8), and left 2 unanswered (Questions 7 and 9). Her willingness to attempt all but two questions and her attention during lessons are great strengths. I encourage her to review the questions she found challenging or did not answer, especially Questions 7, 8, and 9. Practicing similar problems from the supplemental workbook can help reinforce these concepts.\\n\\nHer homework score from last week was 82%, which shows solid understanding but leaves a bit of room for improvement. Continued practice\\u2014especially with rotations and symmetry\\u2014will help her master these skills further.\\n\\nTo support Zoe\\u2019s learning, I recommend:\\n- Completing the stage test before next lesson.\\n- Using extra problems in the supplemental workbook for additional practice.\\n- Attending office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework help or clarification.\\n- Taking advantage of up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n- Reviewing class recordings if she\\u2019d like to revisit specific topics.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Zoe\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaE7Zq\\n\\nThank you for supporting Zoe\\u2019s learning journey. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like specific resources for her.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Isaac demonstrated strong understanding of improper fractions and mixed numbers. He answered 8 out of 9 in-class questions correctly and was consistently engaged, with his camera on and full participation. The only unanswered question was #6, which may have resulted from Isaac arriving a few minutes late. He attended 84 minutes out of the 90-minute class, missing the first 6 minutes. Encouraging Isaac to be on time will help him make the most of each lesson.\\n\\nIsaac also experienced two brief disconnections during class. If these were due to technical issues, I recommend ensuring a stable internet connection; if you need help, Think customer service can assist.\\n\\nOn his previous homework, Isaac scored an impressive 92%. This reflects his diligence and solid grasp of last week's rotation concepts.\\n\\nTo further strengthen his skills, I encourage Isaac to:\\n- Complete the stage test before next week.\\n- Use the extra supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice.\\n- Attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook support.\\n- Access class recordings if he ever misses content due to absences or disconnections.\\n- Take advantage of up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. More detailed performance information is available in the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JMDByY\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there\\u2019s anything I can do to support Isaac\\u2019s learning.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Catherine explored improper fractions and mixed numbers, including how to represent them visually, locate them on a number line, and simplify fractions. I was pleased to see that she participated with focus and kept her camera on, which helped foster a positive learning environment.\\n\\nCatherine answered 9 questions in class, with 6 fully correct, 1 partially correct (question 3), and 1 incorrect (question 8). She did not answer question 9. Her overall accuracy shows good understanding, but there is room for improvement with challenging or unfamiliar problems. Reviewing questions 3 and 8 together at home could help solidify her grasp of these concepts. If Catherine has questions, I encourage her to bring them to our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT, or to make use of up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester (book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/).\\n\\nOn her recent homework (rotations and symmetry), Catherine earned 81%. This is a strong result, and with a bit more careful review, she can push even higher. Additional supplemental problems are available in the workbook and upon request, and class recordings are always available for review.\\n\\nPlease see Catherine\\u2019s in-class report for detailed information: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMnkN. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss strategies to support Catherine\\u2019s growth.

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. Here is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI\\u2019m happy to share an update on Angela\\u2019s week in math class. This week, we focused on improper fractions and mixed numbers\\u2014how to represent them visually, work with number lines, and simplify fractions.\\n\\nAngela was engaged and attentive throughout class and kept her camera on, which really supports her participation. She answered 7 out of 9 in-class questions correctly, showing strong understanding of the new content. The two questions Angela did not answer were #1 and #9. Angela missed the first few minutes of class, which likely contributed to not answering the early question, and there was also one disconnection that may have affected her ability to complete the last question. To help her get the most out of class, I encourage you to help Angela attend on time each week and to troubleshoot any technical issues before class begins. Please feel free to reach out to Think customer service if you need support with connectivity.\\n\\nAngela\\u2019s homework score from last week was 94%, which is excellent and reflects her strong grasp of the previous material.\\n\\nTo further strengthen her skills, Angela can try supplemental problems in the workbook or request extra practice if she\\u2019d like more challenge. Office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for additional support, and class and office hour recordings are posted for review. If Angela would benefit from more individualized help, you may book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support at home. For more detailed information on Angela\\u2019s performance, you can review her in-class report at https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5Oqa.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or would like specific recommendations for Angela\\u2019s learning.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nDear Jayden,\\n\\nThis week, our class began exploring improper fractions and mixed numbers, including how to represent and identify them using visual models and number lines, and how to simplify fractions. Eason was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, consistently keeping his camera on and participating positively.\\n\\nDuring our in-class activities, Eason answered 7 questions. He answered 3 of these correctly and did not attempt two (questions #3 and #4). Questions #2 and #6 were answered incorrectly. While there\\u2019s clear evidence that Eason is grasping parts of the new material, I recommend he review the lesson concepts, especially focusing on the steps for identifying and working with improper fractions and mixed numbers.\\n\\nEason\\u2019s homework score from last week was 85%, which demonstrates strong effort and understanding of our previous unit on rotations and symmetry. I encourage him to continue this diligence by reviewing any missed homework problems to strengthen his skills further.\\n\\nTo support Eason\\u2019s learning this week, I suggest:\\n- Completing all supplemental workbook problems related to improper fractions and mixed numbers for extra practice.\\n- Attending our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for additional help.\\n- If he would benefit from more personalized support, please consider booking one of our up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nRecordings of all classes and office hours are also available for review. For a full breakdown of Eason\\u2019s in-class performance, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5POn.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support of Eason\\u2019s learning. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like additional resources.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.  \\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity  \\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.  \\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation  \\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.  \\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.  \\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline  \\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.  \\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.  \\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.  \\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.  \\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nThis week, Nicole worked on improper fractions and mixed numbers, focusing on representing these with visual models, identifying them on number lines, and simplifying them. Nicole was highly engaged and attentive in class, consistently keeping her camera on and participating actively. She answered 7 in-class questions, with 4 fully correct and 1 partially correct (question #3). She struggled most with question #6 and left question #4 unanswered. I appreciate her willingness to try each problem and her positive attitude throughout the lesson.\\n\\nNicole\\u2019s homework from last week, which covered rotations and rotational symmetry, was completed with a perfect score of 100%. Excellent work! This shows strong understanding and effort outside of class.\\n\\nTo build confidence with improper fractions and mixed numbers, I recommend Nicole review the types of questions she found challenging in class, especially by revisiting question #6 and reviewing her partial answer to question #3. The supplemental workbook includes extra practice problems, and more are available upon request. If Nicole would benefit from additional support, I encourage her to attend our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, or to review class and office hour recordings if she cannot attend live. She is also eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. For more detailed information about Nicole\\u2019s in-class performance, please see the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDX1m4.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nI\\u2019m pleased to share Jamie\\u2019s progress this week as we began exploring improper fractions and mixed numbers. Jamie was engaged and attentive throughout our 90-minute lesson, participating fully and consistently keeping his camera on. He answered 9 in-class questions, getting 8 correct and 1 partially correct (question #6). This demonstrates strong understanding and careful work. To further solidify his grasp, I recommend Jamie review the concepts related to question #6 before our next session.\\n\\nJamie experienced a brief disconnection during class, missing about one minute. To ensure he can take full advantage of each lesson, please check your home internet connection before class. If technical challenges persist, Think customer service is available to help.\\n\\nOn last week\\u2019s homework about shape rotations and symmetry, Jamie scored 72%. I encourage him to review any missed questions and attend office hours on Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT for additional support. The supplemental workbook also offers extra practice problems, and I am happy to provide more upon request.\\n\\nFor more focused help, you may book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester using this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease encourage Jamie to complete the stage test and reach out if you have questions or would like further resources. You can find more detailed information in Jamie's in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl4agW.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher

She answered 9 in-class questions, getting 7 correct. She did not answer question 1 and struggled with question 8. Annabelle missed the first 11 minutes of class and also experienced a short disconnection; this may have contributed to her missing one early question. To help her get the most from each lesson, I encourage you to help her log in on time and check your internet connection before class. If you need technical assistance, our Think customer service team is happy to help.\\n\\nAnnabelle\\u2019s engagement was excellent\\u2014she was attentive and contributed positively to our discussions. Her homework score last week was 90%, which shows strong understanding of rotational symmetry and transformations. If Annabelle would like to strengthen her skills further, she can work through extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT are a great opportunity for homework support, and class recordings are available in the app. For personalized attention, you may also book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease let me know if there\\u2019s anything specific I can help Annabelle with.

It is available in the Student app below lesson 8.\\n\\nHere is a summary of the topics covered in the parent meeting. The recording and slides are available in the Lesson 8 module of the student app\\u2014the slides can be found in the lesson notes at the end.\\n\\nFall-Spring Curriculum Continuity\\n\\n- The Fall-Spring curriculum emphasizes continuity rather than standalone modules. Skills learned in the fall will be developed further in the spring.\\n- Students will build on prior concepts by working through more complex operations, including multiplying and dividing with fractions and decimals, and beginning pre-algebra aligned with CC6 standards.\\n\\nMath Kangaroo (MK) Preparation\\n\\n- For students planning to participate in Math Kangaroo, monthly mock exams have been distributed via email and are available in the Learning Materials section of the Student app.\\n- Spring plan: additional office hours will be offered to review MK questions, and short-term boot camp classes will be available to boost preparation.\\n- Registration reminders: Regular MK registration ends on December 31. Please contact us if you have any questions about Math Kangaroo.\\n\\nSpring Registration Timeline\\n\\n- As of October 17 (Friday), all courses are viewable in the system.\\n- Registration opens on October 22 at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.\\n- Course swaps begin on October 27.\\n- The $50 coupon is valid through October 30.\\n- Referral discount: we offer a $50 discount for each referral who completes their first class.\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nAgnes continues to be a delight in class\\u2014she is consistently engaged and attentive, and I appreciate that she always has her camera on. This week, we focused on improper fractions and mixed numbers, using visual models and number lines, as well as simplifying fractions. Agnes answered 9 in-class questions, with 6 answered correctly, 1 partially correct (question #7), and 1 incorrect (question #8). She did not answer question #6. I encourage Agnes to review these specific questions to solidify her understanding.\\n\\nFor homework, Agnes scored 68% on last week\\u2019s assignment about rotations and symmetry. With a bit more practice connecting the concepts from class to homework, I am confident she will see even more progress.\\n\\nTo help Agnes strengthen her skills, I recommend she work through the extra supplemental problems in the workbook and make use of the additional practice problems available upon request. Attending office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app is another great way for her to get support on both homework and workbook questions. If she ever misses a lesson or wants to review, recordings of all classes and office hours are available in the app. Additionally, Agnes is eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester\\u2014these can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. If you would like more detailed information on Agnes\\u2019s in-class performance, you can view her report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JmeMDZ. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss Agnes\\u2019s progress further.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher
