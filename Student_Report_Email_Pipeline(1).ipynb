    "4. Do not mention the specific areas that the in-class questions covered, beyond the general subject matter covered in the lesson. That information is not available to you.\n",
    "5. There is no need to mention detailed attendance data (e.g. how many minutes the student did or did not attend) if the student attended the entire lesson or was entirely absent.\n",
    "6. If the student was partially absent, describe attendance data in minutes, not percentages. Since the full class time is 90 minutes, you would say to the parent of a child who missed 10% of the class that the child \"missed 9 minutes of class\". Round to the nearest minute.\n",
    "7. Unless otherwise specified in the above instructions, mention and comment on the student's homework score (as a percentage). If the student did not complete the homework, say they did not complete it and encourage them to complete it. Do not provide feedback about specific questions on the homework, since that information is not available to you\n",
    "8. Provide actionable recommendations based on the data\n",
    "9. If student was absent, focus on homework feedback and offer catch-up resources\n",
    "10. If provided above, include the in-class report link at the end of the email and mention to the parent they can find more detailed performance information in it.\n",
    "11. Be encouraging but honest about areas needing improvement\n",
    "12. Include relevant resources based on student's needs. If recommending 1-on-1 tutoring, include the tutoring link in the email.\n",
    "13. Keep tone warm, professional, and personalized\n",
    "14. Keep the feedback part (not including extra section) between 200-300 words. If the extra section is present, it should be written ABOVE/BEFORE the main email body and is not included in the word count. If an extra section was not mentioned, ignore this instruction.\n",
    "15. Do NOT use generic template language\n",
    "16. Do NOT include a subject at the top of the email body\n",
    "17. Do NOT use asterisks ** to indicate bold, this is for markdown and does not work for plain text.\n",
    "18. After the English email, write the exact same email translated into Mandarin Chinese.\n",

During our recent lessons on aligning and adding/subtracting decimals with differing place values, Jerry showed solid engagement and attentiveness, keeping his camera on consistently which really helps with focus.\\n\\nIn class, he answered 12 questions: 8 were correct, 2 partially correct (questions #1 and #5), 1 incorrect (#3), and he left 1 question (#12) unanswered. These specific questions might be good starting points for review to ensure he fully grasps those concepts. His willingness to participate actively is a strong asset, and with a little extra practice on those tricky problems, I\\u2019m confident he will improve further.\\n\\nJerry\\u2019s previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs earned a strong 92%. I recommend encouraging him to watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and deepen his understanding. For additional support, feel free to have him try some extra supplemental problems in the workbook or reach out during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app. Also, remember he has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease find more detailed information in his in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JbWMxx.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and I look forward to seeing Jerry\\u2019s progress next week.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Sara\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bJerry\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u548c\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\uff0cJerry\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5bf9\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u5f88\\u6709\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff1a8\\u4e2a\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c2\\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c1\\u4e2a\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u67091\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff08\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\uff09\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u5177\\u4f53\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u548cJerry\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u590d\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u7406\\u89e3\\u76f8\\u5173\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u662f\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u4f18\\u52bf\\uff0c\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u96be\\u70b9\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u66f4\\u5927\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\nJerry\\u4e0a\\u4e00\\u4efd\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4e3a92%\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f88\\u4e0d\\u9519\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u6790\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u82e5\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8ba9\\u4ed6\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9PDT\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff08\\u901a\\u8fc7Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\uff09\\u3002\\u53e6\\u5916\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u4eab\\u6709\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u4efd\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u67e5\\u770b\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JbWMxx\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u671f\\u5f85Jerry\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u597d\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

She demonstrated strong engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on consistently, which really helped her stay focused. In our recent lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values, she answered 9 out of 10 in-class questions correctly. The only question she struggled with was question #10, and I will continue to support her in mastering that area.  \\n\\nHowever, Hannah did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I encourage her to complete that assignment as soon as possible, as it will reinforce important skills and keep her on track.  \\n\\nTo help Hannah strengthen her skills, she is welcome to work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook. If she wants additional challenges, I\\u2019m happy to provide more problems tailored for her.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Mike has been engaged and attentive during class this week, keeping his camera on consistently, which helps maintain his focus. We covered aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits fall in different place values, along with some fun math puzzles related to these operations.  \\n\\nMike answered 12 in-class questions with 9 correct, 1 partially correct (Question #4), 1 incorrect (Question #12), and 1 unanswered (Question #1). It looks like he missed answering the first question, which might be related to arriving a few minutes late to class. I understand that sometimes things come up, but encouraging Mike to join on time will help him stay fully engaged from the start. Also, he experienced one disconnection during class, possibly during a break. If technical issues persist, please feel free to contact Think customer service for support to ensure smoother attendance.  \\n\\nRegarding homework, Mike did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on plotting and interpreting line graphs and using trend lines to predict values. Completing homework on time is important for reinforcing concepts and staying on track. I encourage him to complete this homework soon and keep up with future assignments.  \\n\\nTo support Mike\\u2019s learning, he can work on extra supplemental problems available in the workbook or request additional practice questions. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT provide a great opportunity for homework help. For more personalized support, Mike is eligible for up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Mike\\u2019s performance in this week\\u2019s class in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v0lEpo.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Emily,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Peter\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when their digits do not line up by place value, along with solving some fun math puzzles using these skills.\\n\\nPeter was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, keeping his camera on consistently, which I appreciate. Out of the 10 in-class questions, he answered 8 correctly. He struggled a bit with questions #9 and #10, leaving #9 unanswered and getting #10 incorrect. These areas provide a great opportunity for additional practice to reinforce his understanding.\\n\\nFor homework, Peter scored 85% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and deciding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes, which will help deepen his grasp of these concepts.\\n\\nTo support Peter further, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice if needed. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are an excellent chance for homework and workbook help. Should Peter want more personalized attention, he can use up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Peter\\u2019s detailed in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JZgDGP. I\\u2019m confident that with a bit more practice on those specific questions, Peter will continue to improve steadily.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming parent meeting.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u827e\\u7c73\\u4e3d\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u5f7c\\u5f97\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5f53\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u6b63\\u786e\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u8fd0\\u7b97\\uff0c\\u540c\\u65f6\\u8fd8\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u6765\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5f7c\\u5f97\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u70b9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u300210\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e868\\u9053\\u3002\\u7b2c9\\u9898\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff0c\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\u7b54\\u9519\\u4e86\\u3002\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e24\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u4ed6\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u76f8\\u5173\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u5f7c\\u5f97\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u4e8685\\u5206\\uff0c\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u5305\\u62ec\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u5224\\u65ad\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6216\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u652f\\u6301\\u5f7c\\u5f97\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u975e\\u5e38\\u9002\\u5408\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5f7c\\u5f97\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u5b66\\u6821\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u70b9\\u51fb\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5f7c\\u5f97\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JZgDGP\\u3002\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u53ea\\u8981\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e24\\u9053\\u9898\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u5f7c\\u5f97\\u4f1a\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7a33\\u6b65\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u671f\\u5f85\\u5728\\u5373\\u5c06\\u5230\\u6765\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\u4f1a\\u4e0a\\u89c1\\u5230\\u60a8\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\n\\u5965\\u9a6c\\u5c14\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:\\nDear Maggie,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Arthur\\u2019s progress in class this week. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits are in different place values, and also solved some engaging math puzzles using these skills.\\n\\nArthur participated actively and kept his camera on throughout the class, showing strong engagement. He answered 12 questions in class, getting 10 correct, 1 partially correct (question #10), and 1 incorrect (question #12). His one partially correct and one incorrect answer suggest some areas we can reinforce together. Arthur missed 2 minutes of class due to arriving late, which might have impacted his ability to respond to earlier questions. I understand things can come up, but encouraging him to join on time will help him fully benefit from each session. Additionally, he experienced one disconnection during class, possibly related to the break. Ensuring stable internet and contacting Think customer service if issues persist would be helpful.\\n\\nArthur\\u2019s homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs was excellent, scoring 100%. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to deepen his understanding and self-correct if needed.\\n\\nTo support Arthur further, he can try extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Wei,\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Karl\\u2019s progress this week. He showed great focus and engagement during our lessons, keeping his camera on and fully participating. He answered 12 in-class questions with 11 correct and only missed question #12. This demonstrates a strong grasp of the material, especially given the challenge of aligning and adding/subtracting decimals with uneven place values.  \\n\\nHowever, Karl did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. Completing this homework will be important for reinforcing those concepts and preparing him for upcoming lessons. Encouraging him to submit homework on time will help him stay on track and build confidence in applying these skills.\\n\\nTo support Karl further, he can work on extra problems from the supplemental workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice if needed. We also hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework help, and recordings are available if he can\\u2019t attend live. Additionally, Karl is eligible for up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester\\u2014feel free to book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease find more detailed information about Karl\\u2019s in-class performance in this report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1Npyl.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jinying,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Anna\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math lesson, where we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values and solving related math puzzles. Anna was engaged and attentive throughout the class, and she kept her camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nAnna answered 12 in-class questions, correctly solving 8 of them. She struggled with question #3 and did not answer questions #8, #9, and #11. These particular questions could be good targets for review with her to strengthen her confidence and skills. Although she participated actively, I encourage Anna to take a moment to attempt all questions during class time to maximize her learning.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Anna did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. It would be beneficial for her to complete this work soon, as it builds important graphing skills that support her math foundation. Please encourage her to turn in homework on time moving forward to keep up with the class pace.\\n\\nTo support Anna\\u2019s learning, she is welcome to use extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I can provide additional practice problems upon request. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT are a great opportunity for homework and workbook help. If Anna would benefit from more personalized support, she can book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed insights, you can view Anna\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaEagz.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u91d1\\u82f1\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u8ba1\\u7b97\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u76f8\\u5173\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u79ef\\u6781\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e868\\u9053\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u4e14\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7b2c8\\u30019\\u548c11\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f5c\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u590d\\u4e60\\u7684\\u91cd\\u70b9\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u548c\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\u867d\\u7136\\u5979\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5c3d\\u91cf\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u6240\\u6709\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u6700\\u5927\\u5316\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u6548\\u679c\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u6709\\u5173\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u5c3d\\u5feb\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u90e8\\u5206\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5bf9\\u5979\\u638c\\u63e1\\u91cd\\u8981\\u7684\\u56fe\\u8868\\u6280\\u80fd\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6709\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u8bf7\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u4fbf\\u8ddf\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u4ee5\\u5916\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\u96c6\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u975e\\u5e38\\u9002\\u5408\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u4e60\\u9898\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u514d\\u8d39\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5b89\\u5a1c\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaEagz\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\n\\u5965\\u9a6c\\u5c14\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

He has been engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, keeping his camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see. We covered how to align and add/subtract decimal numbers with differing place values, along with some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations.\\n\\nKai answered 12 in-class questions, with 8 correct, 1 partially correct (question #11), 1 incorrect (question #3), and 2 unanswered (questions #1 and #4). I noticed he missed the first and fourth questions, which may be related to his arriving a few minutes late. I understand things can sometimes come up, but encouraging Kai to join on time will help him not miss important early material. He also experienced one brief disconnection during class, possibly around the break. Please ensure his internet connection is stable, and feel free to contact Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Kai did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on line graphs and trend lines. I encourage him to complete it soon to keep up with the material. To support his learning, we have extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Liuying,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Jessica's progress in this week's math class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when the place values differ, along with solving some engaging math puzzles using these skills.\\n\\nJessica participated actively throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on and showing great attentiveness. She answered 11 in-class questions with excellent accuracy, getting 10 fully correct and 1 partially correct (question #9). This shows strong understanding, though that particular question might benefit from a quick review to ensure full mastery.\\n\\nRegarding her homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs, Jessica scored 85%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and strengthen her grasp of these concepts.\\n\\nTo support Jessica further, please remind her that extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and she can always request additional practice if she wishes. I also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. If she would like more personalized support, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions are available this semester\\u2014feel free to book at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in Jessica\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RkqxMX.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

He showed great engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson, with his camera consistently on, which really helped his participation. In our recent class, Evan answered 12 questions: he got 7 correct, 4 partially correct, and only 1 incorrect (Question #12). He partially struggled with Questions #1, #4, #6, and #10, so reviewing those together might be helpful.\\n\\nEvan\\u2019s homework score was 85%, which is solid, though I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to better understand and correct any errors. Also, please encourage Evan to take clearer photos of his workbook work, as blurry images make it difficult to assess his answers accurately.\\n\\nTo support his learning, remind him that extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I can provide additional problems upon request. He is also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if he cannot attend live. Additionally, up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester are offered, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Evan\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JjLebK.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bEvan\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u3002\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0cEvan\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\uff1a\\u5176\\u4e2d7\\u9053\\u9898\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c4\\u9053\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u4ec5\\u67091\\u9053\\u9898\\uff08\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\uff09\\u7b54\\u9519\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c1\\u30014\\u30016\\u548c10\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u548c\\u4ed6\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u518d\\u590d\\u4e60\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\n\\nEvan\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u662f85%\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4e0d\\u9519\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u7406\\u89e3\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u540c\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u9f13\\u52b1Evan\\u62cd\\u6444\\u66f4\\u6e05\\u6670\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u7167\\u7247\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u6a21\\u7cca\\u7684\\u7167\\u7247\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u96be\\u4ee5\\u51c6\\u786e\\u5224\\u65ad\\u7b54\\u6848\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u4ed6\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u4e13\\u95e8\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u76f8\\u5173\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u82e5\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u89c2\\u770b\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u53ef\\u4eab\\u53d73\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6709\\u5173Evan\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u6b64\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JjLebK\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Jessie did very well with the lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, showing strong understanding and engagement throughout.

Her focus was excellent, and she kept her camera on consistently, which helped maintain her active participation.\\n\\nJessie\\u2019s previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs was completed with a perfect score of 100%, which is wonderful to see. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to reinforce her learning and ensure she feels confident with the material. \\n\\nTo support Jessie further, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I can provide additional practice problems upon request. I also hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook questions she might have.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI\\u2019m pleased to share that Austin has been very engaged and attentive in class this week, consistently keeping his camera on and participating actively. During our recent lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values, Austin answered 10 questions, getting 9 correct and 1 partially correct (specifically question #8). This shows strong understanding overall, with just a minor area to revisit for clarity.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed that Austin did not complete his homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and knowing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Completing this homework will be important to reinforce these concepts and keep pace with the class. I encourage Austin to submit his homework on time moving forward to support his steady progress.\\n\\nTo support Austin, we have extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. He is also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework help. Additionally, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Recordings of classes and office hours are accessible if he cannot attend live sessions.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Austin\\u2019s detailed in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RkqxbD.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Sophia\\u2019s progress in math this week. She is showing great engagement and attentiveness in class, with her camera consistently on, which positively contributes to her learning environment. During our recent lessons on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when the digits are not in the same place values, Sophia answered 12 questions, getting 8 fully correct, 3 partially correct (#1, #8, and #9), and only one incorrect (#12). This shows strong understanding, though the questions she partially missed or answered incorrectly are good targets for review to solidify her skills.  \\n\\nSophia\\u2019s previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs scored 73%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes, which will help improve her grasp on when to use line graphs versus bar graphs and how to predict future values using trend lines.  \\n\\nTo further support her growth, she can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. Also, please remind Sophia that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for help with homework or workbook questions. For more tailored support, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available each semester and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Sophia\\u2019s in-class performance in this report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5zba.  \\n\\nThank you for your continued support. I\\u2019m confident with focused review and practice, Sophia will keep making strong strides in math!  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bSophia\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u6781\\u9ad8\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u4e14\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u73af\\u5883\\u5e26\\u6765\\u4e86\\u79ef\\u6781\\u5f71\\u54cd\\u3002\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u548c\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u4e0d\\u5728\\u76f8\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u5341\\u8fdb\\u5236\\u6570\\u5b57\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\uff0cSophia\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d8\\u9898\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c3\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u3001\\u7b2c8\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c9\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u4ec5\\u67091\\u9898\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8f83\\u597d\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5979\\u90e8\\u5206\\u7b54\\u9519\\u548c\\u7b54\\u4e0d\\u5b8c\\u6574\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u503c\\u5f97\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u590d\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5979\\u7684\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5979\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a73%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeSophia\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6216\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5229\\u7528\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0cSophia\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u82e5\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u540c\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192Sophia\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u901a\\u8fc7Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u7b54\\u7591\\u73ed\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u82e5\\u9700\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bSophia\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5zba\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6709\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u6027\\u7684\\u590d\\u4e60\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0cSophia\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u6c34\\u5e73\\u5c06\\u4f1a\\u6301\\u7eed\\u63d0\\u5347\\uff01  \\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

I am pleased to share that Jocelyn demonstrated excellent understanding this week during our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values. She answered all 10 in-class questions correctly, showing strong comprehension and engagement. Jocelyn was attentive throughout the class and kept her camera on, which positively contributed to her focus.\\n\\nShe missed 4 minutes of class due to one disconnection, possibly related to the break. To support continuous learning, please ensure her internet connection is stable during lessons. If technical issues persist, Think customer service is available to assist.\\n\\nFor homework, Jocelyn scored 91% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs and using trend lines. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to review any errors and reinforce her skills. Supplemental problems are available in the workbook if she wants extra practice, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Jocelyn that office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, which can be a great time for extra help.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Colin,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Clark\\u2019s progress in our recent math lessons. This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values and solving math puzzles involving decimal operations. Clark actively participated throughout the lesson, keeping his camera on and showing strong engagement. He answered 12 in-class questions, getting 10 correct and leaving 2 unanswered (#10 and #11). These unanswered questions could be good targets for review to ensure full understanding.\\n\\nClark\\u2019s previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs was excellent, scoring 100%. Encouraging him to watch the homework solution video could help reinforce his great work and address any minor uncertainties he might have.\\n\\nTo support Clark further, I recommend he try some extra supplemental problems in the workbook that reinforce decimals. Additionally, he can join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook help. If you feel he would benefit from more personalized attention, remember that he has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Clark\\u2019s detailed performance in the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vQX3mo. I\\u2019m very pleased with his focus and progress and look forward to seeing his continued growth. Don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like additional resources.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Colin\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u8ddf\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bClark\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7528\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002Clark\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u79ef\\u6781\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u6295\\u5165\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d10\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c2\\u9053\\uff08\\u7b2c10\\u548c\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\uff09\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e24\\u9053\\u672a\\u7b54\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f5c\\u4e3a\\u590d\\u4e60\\u7684\\u91cd\\u70b9\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u4ed6\\u5145\\u5206\\u7406\\u89e3\\u76f8\\u5173\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\n\\nClark\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u8272\\uff0c\\u5f97\\u4e86100\\u5206\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u4f18\\u79c0\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5e76\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u5b58\\u5728\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u7591\\u60d1\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301Clark\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u4e4b\\u5916\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u80fd\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97\\u4ed6\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u522b\\u5fd8\\u4e86\\u4ed6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u6709\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770bClark\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vQX3mo\\u3002\\u6211\\u5bf9\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u611f\\u5230\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6ee1\\u610f\\uff0c\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4ed6\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u6210\\u957f\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Maggie has shown excellent engagement and attentiveness in class this week, consistently keeping her camera on and participating actively. She answered 9 out of 10 in-class questions correctly, with only one question (#9) being partially correct, which is very encouraging progress.  \\n\\nThis week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when their place values differ, along with solving some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations. Maggie handled these topics well, demonstrating strong understanding and application skills.  \\n\\nHowever, I noticed Maggie did not complete her homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, trend lines, and comparing graph types. Completing homework on time is important to reinforce learning, so I encourage Maggie to catch up on this assignment soon. Please remind her of our available resources, including extra workbook problems and office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework or workbook questions.  \\n\\nIf Maggie would like additional support, she can also book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester through this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Maggie\\u2019s performance in this week\\u2019s class in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWzYx.  \\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002Maggie \\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u8272\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5e76\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u4e5f\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u542f\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8610\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u76849\\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d\\u7b2c9\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4ee4\\u4eba\\u9f13\\u821e\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u3002Maggie \\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u826f\\u597d\\uff0c\\u5c55\\u73b0\\u4e86\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u548c\\u5e94\\u7528\\u80fd\\u529b\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230 Maggie \\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5bf9\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u975e\\u5e38\\u91cd\\u8981\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae Maggie \\u5c3d\\u5feb\\u8865\\u4ea4\\u8fd9\\u6b21\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u5979\\u5229\\u7528\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u5305\\u62ec\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u901a\\u8fc7 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u90a3\\u91cc\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c Maggie \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5979\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/ \\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWzYx \\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u7591\\u8651\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

He participated actively and was engaged throughout the lesson, keeping his camera on and showing consistent attention. John answered 12 questions in class, with 8 correct, 3 partially correct, and only 1 incorrect\\u2014specifically on question #12. He also had some difficulty with questions #8, #10, and #11, where his answers were partially correct. Overall, he is grasping the concepts well but could benefit from reviewing these questions for better understanding. \\n\\nJohn missed 2 minutes of class due to two brief disconnections, possibly during the break. To ensure he doesn\\u2019t miss important content, please help him troubleshoot any technical issues. If needed, Think customer service is available for support.\\n\\nRegarding homework, John scored 85% on the recent assignment about line graphs and trend lines. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to identify and correct any mistakes, which will strengthen his skills further.\\n\\nFor extra practice, John can use the supplemental workbook problems, and if he needs more challenges, I\\u2019m happy to provide additional resources.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Hamsika\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. She remained engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, keeping her camera consistently on, which really helped her stay focused. She answered 11 in-class questions with 10 correct responses and did not answer question #10. This shows strong understanding of the material covered, and I encourage her to revisit that particular question to strengthen her grasp.\\n\\nThis week we focused on how to align and add or subtract decimal numbers when their place values don\\u2019t line up exactly, along with solving some fun math puzzles using those skills. Hamsika demonstrated very good mastery in class activities.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Hamsika scored 92% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I recommend encouraging her to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to deepen her understanding. If she needs extra practice, supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nWe also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. Additionally, recordings of classes and office hours are available if she cannot attend live. If you feel Hamsika would benefit from more personalized support, please consider using up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester by booking here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed insights into Hamsika\\u2019s class performance, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vAmzM8.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. It\\u2019s a pleasure to work with Hamsika, and I\\u2019m confident she will keep progressing well.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bHamsika\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d10\\u9898\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c\\u95ee\\u9898#10\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8bf4\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u672c\\u5468\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8f83\\u597d\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u8fd9\\u9053\\u672a\\u7b54\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u8fd0\\u7b97\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u5f53\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u65f6\\u7684\\u5904\\u7406\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u505a\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\uff0cHamsika\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u6d3b\\u52a8\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u638c\\u63e1\\u80fd\\u529b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cHamsika\\u5728\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6216\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4e8692%\\u7684\\u597d\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u968f\\u65f6\\u5411\\u6211\\u7d22\\u53d6\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fceHamsika\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u7684\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u7684\\u5b66\\u751f\\u89c2\\u770b\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Hamsika\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u5229\\u7528\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u670d\\u52a1\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vAmzM8\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u4e0eHamsika\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u5979\\u4f1a\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jieying,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some updates on Luna\\u2019s progress in our recent math class. This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when their digits don\\u2019t line up in the same place values, and we explored some fun math puzzles using these skills. Luna participated actively and attentively throughout the lesson, and her camera was consistently on, which helped her stay engaged.\\n\\nShe answered 11 questions in class, getting 10 correct and only one incorrect (question #11). This shows a strong understanding of the topic, though I recommend reviewing that particular question together to ensure full clarity. Luna\\u2019s previous homework score was excellent at 96%, and I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to learn from any small mistakes she made.\\n\\nTo further support her learning, feel free to have her work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and please know that additional practice problems are available upon request. Also, Luna can join our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app if she needs help with homework or workbook questions. If you feel Luna would benefit from more personalized attention, we offer up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can easily book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor a detailed look at Luna\\u2019s in-class performance, you can review the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/voG1ZP.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. Luna is making great strides, and with these resources, I\\u2019m confident she will continue to grow her skills.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684Jieying\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bLuna\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5f53\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u65f6\\u5982\\u4f55\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u4e86\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002Luna\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u79ef\\u6781\\u4e14\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e86\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d10\\u4e2a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\u7b54\\u9519\\u4e86\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u663e\\u793a\\u51fa\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u672c\\u6b21\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u5df2\\u6709\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u548c\\u5979\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u590d\\u4e60\\u90a3\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u638c\\u63e1\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u4f18\\u5f02\\uff0c\\u8fbe\\u5230\\u4e8696%\\uff0c\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u4ece\\u5c0f\\u9519\\u8bef\\u4e2d\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8ba9\\u5979\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u9644\\u52a0\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u82e5\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0cLuna\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u7591\\u95ee\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Luna\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bLuna\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/voG1ZP \\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5982\\u65e2\\u5f80\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002Luna\\u6b63\\u5728\\u4e0d\\u65ad\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u501f\\u52a9\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u5979\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u80fd\\u529b\\u4f1a\\u6301\\u7eed\\u63d0\\u5347\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

He demonstrated good engagement and kept his camera on throughout the class, which was great to see. Haorui answered 11 in-class questions, correctly solving 6 and partially answering question #7. He did not answer questions #1, #9, #10, and #11, which likely relates to him leaving class about 13 minutes early. I understand things can come up, but I encourage ensuring he stays until the end of class so he can complete all questions and benefit fully from the lesson.\\n\\nAlthough Haorui was attentive during class, he experienced one disconnection, possibly during the break. If technical issues persist, please consider reaching out to Think customer service for support to help maintain continuous attendance.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Haorui did not complete the assignment on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding graph types. Completing homework on time is important for reinforcing concepts, so please encourage him to finish it soon. We have extra supplemental problems in the workbook available, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.\\n\\nHaorui is welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework help. Also, remember he has up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester if extra support would be helpful: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on Haorui\\u2019s class performance, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97MZgZ.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u6d69\\u777f\\u672c\\u5468\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u70b9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002\\u6d69\\u777f\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d6\\u9053\\u56de\\u7b54\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c7\\u53f7\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b541\\u53f7\\u30019\\u53f7\\u300110\\u53f7\\u548c11\\u53f7\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5f88\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u4e0e\\u4ed6\\u63d0\\u524d\\u79bb\\u5f00\\u8bfe\\u580213\\u5206\\u949f\\u6709\\u5173\\u3002\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7a81\\u53d1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5c3d\\u91cf\\u8ba9\\u4ed6\\u575a\\u6301\\u4e0a\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u90e8\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6837\\u4ed6\\u80fd\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u6240\\u6709\\u95ee\\u9898\\u5e76\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u5438\\u6536\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u867d\\u7136\\u6d69\\u777f\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u4ed6\\u7ecf\\u5386\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u5728\\u4f11\\u606f\\u671f\\u95f4\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6301\\u7eed\\u51fa\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u8003\\u8651\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u4ee5\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6280\\u672f\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u8fde\\u7eed\\u51fa\\u5e2d\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u6d69\\u777f\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u672c\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u53ca\\u56fe\\u8868\\u7c7b\\u578b\\u9009\\u62e9\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5bf9\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u975e\\u5e38\\u91cd\\u8981\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u5c3d\\u5feb\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6709\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6d69\\u777f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u5982\\u9700\\u989d\\u5916\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u67e5\\u770b\\u6d69\\u777f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97MZgZ\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\n\\u656c\\u793c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

He has been very engaged and attentive throughout class, and I appreciate that he consistently kept his camera on, which helps with interaction. Shane answered 11 questions during the lesson, correctly solving 10 of them. The only question he struggled with was question #11, so I recommend spending some extra time reviewing that specific problem to ensure he fully grasps the concept.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on aligning and adding or subtracting decimal numbers even when their place values don\\u2019t match, along with solving some fun math puzzles related to these skills. Shane is showing strong understanding, but a little more practice will help solidify his confidence.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Shane scored 91%, which is excellent. To help him improve even further, please encourage him to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes he made. This reflection is a great way to deepen his learning.\\n\\nFor additional support, Shane can use the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and if you want, I can provide more problems tailored to his needs.

It will happen in the same room as the lesson, so you can just sit with your child after class. Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Nadia,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Olivia\\u2019s progress in class this week. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits don\\u2019t line up in the same place values, along with solving some fun math puzzles using those skills.\\n\\nOlivia was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and she kept her camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see. However, she faced some challenges with several in-class questions. Specifically, she struggled with questions #2, #3, #9, and #11, and did not answer questions #4, #6, #7, #8, and #10. Out of 11 questions, she answered 2 correctly but left 5 unanswered and 4 incorrect. This suggests she may benefit from additional practice with the lesson concepts to build confidence and accuracy.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Olivia did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and choosing between line or bar graphs. I encourage her to complete it soon, as homework is an important part of reinforcing learning and preparing for upcoming topics.\\n\\nTo support Olivia\\u2019s progress, I recommend she try the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, which cover similar skills. She is also welcome to attend office hours on Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for additional help. If you think Olivia would benefit from more personalized guidance, please consider booking one of her up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review her detailed in-class performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RNl3a0. I am happy to discuss ways we can work together to support Olivia\\u2019s growth.

She was very engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which contributed positively to her learning environment. Melissa answered 11 questions in class, getting 10 correct and missing only question #11, showing a strong grasp of the material we covered on decimal addition and subtraction with differing place values.  \\n\\nOne area for growth is that Melissa did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. Completing this homework will help her solidify these concepts and support her success in future lessons. I encourage Melissa to make a habit of submitting homework on time, and I\\u2019m happy to provide extra workbook problems or additional practice if she needs it.  \\n\\nPlease remind Melissa that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework or workbook help. Additionally, she has access to up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can review a detailed breakdown of her performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9Lnz6W. I\\u2019m confident with continued effort and support, Melissa will keep making excellent progress. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if Melissa would benefit from extra practice resources.  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bMelissa\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6295\\u5165\\u548c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u521b\\u9020\\u4e86\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u73af\\u5883\\u3002Melissa\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d10\\u9053\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\u7b54\\u9519\\uff0c\\u663e\\u793a\\u51fa\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u6211\\u4eec\\u672c\\u5468\\u8bb2\\u6388\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff08\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\uff09\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8f83\\u597d\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u9700\\u8981\\u6539\\u8fdb\\u7684\\u662f\\uff0cMelissa\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u76f8\\u5173\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\uff0c\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u672a\\u6765\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeMelissa\\u517b\\u6210\\u6309\\u65f6\\u63d0\\u4ea4\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u7684\\u4e60\\u60ef\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e60\\u9898\\u6216\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192Melissa\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student app\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u4e13\\u95e8\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5b66\\u751f\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9Lnz6W\\u3002\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u5728\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7684\\u52aa\\u529b\\u548c\\u652f\\u6301\\u4e0b\\uff0cMelissa\\u4f1a\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4f18\\u5f02\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216Melissa\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, including some fun math puzzles to reinforce the concepts.\\n\\nRoger answered 11 questions in class, with 6 correct, 1 partially correct, 3 incorrect, and 1 unanswered. He struggled particularly with questions #3, #10, and #11, while question #7 was partially correct, and question #5 was left unanswered. He was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson and kept his camera on, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nHe missed 2 minutes of class due to one disconnection, possibly related to the break. It would be helpful to ensure a stable connection during class, and if technical issues persist, Think customer service can assist.\\n\\nOn homework, Roger scored 80% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and deciding when to use line versus bar graphs. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes.\\n\\nTo support Roger\\u2019s growth, extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I can provide additional practice upon request. He\\u2019s also welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT through the Think Student app for homework and workbook help.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jinyu,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share some feedback on Grace\\u2019s progress this week in class. She was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, keeping her camera consistently on, which really helps her focus. Grace answered 11 questions during class, with 8 correct and 1 partially correct response on question #6. She left questions #10 and #11 unanswered, so these might be good areas to review together.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values and solving math puzzles using these skills. Grace is doing well with the concepts but could benefit from extra practice on the specific challenges posed by the unanswered and partially correct questions.\\n\\nFor homework, Grace scored 80% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to help her correct any mistakes and deepen her understanding.\\n\\nTo support Grace further, she can try extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems from me. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great opportunity for her to get homework help. If you feel Grace would benefit from more personalized support, she can book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Grace\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMX6O.

I want to share some encouraging feedback about Andrew\\u2019s progress in class this week. He participated actively and attentively throughout the lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, handling cases where digits are not in the same place values. Andrew answered 10 out of 11 in-class questions correctly, with just one question (#5) partially correct, showing a strong grasp of the material overall.  \\n\\nAndrew was engaged and kept his camera on consistently, which helped maintain a good classroom atmosphere. He did miss 3 minutes of class due to brief disconnections, possibly during the break. To support uninterrupted learning, please ensure his internet connection is stable; if technical issues persist, Think customer service can assist.  \\n\\nRegarding homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Andrew scored 100%, which is excellent. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to reinforce his understanding and self-correct if needed.  \\n\\nIf Andrew would like extra practice, supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I can provide additional problems upon request. He is also welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. Additionally, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions are available this semester, which you can book at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find a detailed report on Andrew\\u2019s performance here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5pr8.

His camera was consistently on, which helped maintain focus.\\n\\nJohnson answered 11 in-class questions; he got 8 correct, struggled with questions #3 and #11, and did not answer question #10. These specific questions show areas where he could benefit from some extra practice to strengthen his understanding. His homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs was completed with a strong score of 92%. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and deepen his grasp of the concepts.\\n\\nTo support Johnson further, feel free to use the extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems.

Elizabeth has shown great attentiveness and engagement during class this week, consistently keeping her camera on and participating actively. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, as well as solving some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations.\\n\\nElizabeth answered 11 in-class questions; she correctly solved 3 and was partially correct on questions #8 and #9. However, she left 6 questions unanswered (#1, #4, #5, #6, #7, and #10). Encouraging her to attempt all questions will help build confidence and deepen her understanding. \\n\\nI also want to gently remind you that Elizabeth did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. Completing homework on time is important for reinforcing concepts and preparing for upcoming lessons. Please encourage her to finish this assignment, and I\\u2019m happy to provide extra support if needed.\\n\\nTo support Elizabeth further, she can practice additional problems in the workbook or request more exercises. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are available for homework and workbook help. Also, recordings of classes and office hours can be accessed anytime if she misses a session. If you feel Elizabeth would benefit from focused attention, we offer up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Elizabeth\\u2019s detailed in-class performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXzob.

I wanted to share some feedback about Alina\\u2019s work this week in math class. She continues to be a joy to teach\\u2014she\\u2019s engaged, attentive, and keeps her camera on, which really helps us stay connected during class.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers that don\\u2019t have digits in the same place values, and we also practiced solving fun math puzzles using decimal addition and subtraction. Alina did very well overall: she answered 11 in-class questions, with 9 correct, 1 partially correct (Question #10), and 1 incorrect (Question #11). These small missteps are completely normal as we work through more complex decimal problems, and they give us a great chance to review and strengthen her understanding.\\n\\nAlina\\u2019s previous homework on line graphs was strong\\u2014she scored 92%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes, as this will help her solidify the concepts. For extra practice, she can work on the supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems if needed.\\n\\nIf Alina would like some extra support, I recommend our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where we can go over homework and workbook questions. Recordings are also available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. She also has up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can view her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl40BG\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u7b2c15\\u8bfe\\u7ed3\\u675f\\u540e\\u5c06\\u4e3e\\u884c\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u5bb6\\u957f\\u4f1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5c06\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u6625\\u5b63\\u5b66\\u671f\\u7684\\u65e5\\u7a0b\\u5b89\\u6392\\u3001\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u5b89\\u6392\\u3001\\u6559\\u6750\\u90ae\\u5bc4\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u8868\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u5bd2\\u5047\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u4f1a\\u8bae\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0e\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u76f8\\u540c\\u7684\\u6559\\u5ba4\\u4e3e\\u884c\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u6b64\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u540e\\u76f4\\u63a5\\u548c\\u5b69\\u5b50\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u7559\\u4e0b\\u3002\\u671f\\u5f85\\u5c4a\\u65f6\\u89c1\\u5230\\u60a8\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u534e\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff1a\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bAlina\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4f4d\\u4ee4\\u4eba\\u6109\\u5feb\\u7684\\u5b66\\u751f\\u2014\\u2014\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u3001\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u80fd\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u4e92\\u52a8\\u3002\\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u3002Alina\\u6574\\u4f53\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f88\\u597d\\uff1a\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d9\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u9053\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c1\\u9053\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u5c0f\\u5931\\u8bef\\u5728\\u5904\\u7406\\u66f4\\u590d\\u6742\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u95ee\\u9898\\u65f6\\u662f\\u5f88\\u6b63\\u5e38\\u7684\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u6b63\\u597d\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6709\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5e76\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5979\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\nAlina\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5f97\\u4e0d\\u9519\\uff0c\\u5f97\\u5206\\u662f92%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u8ba2\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60f3\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u505a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u4e50\\u610f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cAlina\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u540c\\u5b66\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u3002\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl40BG\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff01  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

She answered all 11 in-class questions correctly, showing a strong grasp of how to align and add or subtract decimal numbers, even when the digits are not in matching place values. Her engagement was consistently high, and she kept her camera on throughout the lessons, which really helps maintain focus.  \\n\\nRegarding her homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Belinda scored 68%. This shows a solid foundation, but there is room for improvement. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video and revisit the assignment to correct any mistakes. This will deepen her understanding and boost her confidence for future tasks.  \\n\\nIf Belinda would like more practice, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, our weekly office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app can offer her personalized help with homework or workbook questions. For targeted support, please remember that she can use up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester; you can book these sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Belinda\\u2019s participation and performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98PYnX.

I wanted to share some feedback on Dena\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math lessons. She was engaged and attentive throughout the class, with her camera consistently on, which helped her participate actively. During our work on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, Dena answered 11 in-class questions: she got 5 correct, 3 partially correct, 2 incorrect (questions #2 and #3), and left 1 unanswered (#11). She also partially answered questions #4, #8, and #10. These results suggest that while Dena is grasping many concepts, there are specific areas where she could benefit from additional practice and review.\\n\\nI noticed she did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines, which is important for reinforcing class concepts. Please encourage her to complete this homework and submit future assignments on time to keep pace with the curriculum.\\n\\nTo support Dena, I recommend she try extra supplemental problems in the workbook, which offer targeted practice. I\\u2019m also available during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework help. Additionally, if you feel Dena would benefit from more personalized instruction, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available this semester; you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about Dena\\u2019s in-class performance, you can view the full report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JmeZK6.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

He was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values, consistently keeping his camera on, which positively supported his focus. Ryan answered 11 in-class questions, getting 10 correct, with only one question (#11) answered incorrectly, showing strong understanding overall.  \\n\\nRegarding homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Ryan scored 65%. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes, which will help solidify his understanding of when to use line graphs versus bar graphs and how to draw trend lines effectively.  \\n\\nTo support Ryan further, supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice if needed. We also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where Ryan can get direct help with homework or workbook questions. If you feel Ryan would benefit from more personalized support, please consider booking one of up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Ryan\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaEa6j.

Christian showed strong engagement during this week\\u2019s class on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, answering 10 out of 11 questions correctly. He struggled slightly with question #10, which we can focus on together to strengthen his understanding. Christian missed 4 minutes of class due to arriving late and experienced three brief disconnections, one possibly related to the break. I understand that occasional disruptions happen, but consistent attendance and stable connectivity are important for uninterrupted learning. Please feel free to reach out to Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nChristian kept his camera on and remained attentive throughout, which is wonderful to see. His recent homework on line graphs scored 91%, showing solid progress. I encourage Christian to watch the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes, which will deepen his understanding.\\n\\nTo support Christian further, extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice upon request. He is also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. Remember, he can book up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Christian\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JMDVPy.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support in helping Christian thrive.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:\\nDear Cindy,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback about Kingston\\u2019s progress in math this week. Kingston demonstrated excellent understanding and skill in aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, answering all 11 in-class questions correctly with full accuracy. He was engaged, attentive throughout the lesson, and kept his camera on consistently, which really helps maintain focus in our virtual environment.\\n\\nKingston did miss 1 minute of class due to a brief disconnection, possibly related to the break. To ensure he benefits fully from each lesson, please check his internet connection or device before class. If technical issues persist, Think customer service can provide support.\\n\\nFor homework, Kingston achieved a perfect score of 100% on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to reinforce his understanding and self-correct if needed.\\n\\nIf Kingston would like extra practice, supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework or workbook help. Remember, Kingston can book up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5pYM.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

She has shown great focus and engagement during our lessons, keeping her camera on and participating attentively, which is wonderful to see.  \\n\\nIn our recent class, we worked on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values, along with solving math puzzles related to these concepts. Fiona answered 11 questions in class, with 10 correct and just one incorrect response on question #11. This shows she is grasping the material well but may benefit from a quick review of that last question to solidify her understanding.  \\n\\nFor homework, Fiona scored a perfect 100% on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and deciding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to reinforce her skills and catch any small errors she might have made.  \\n\\nTo support Fiona further, she can explore extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app offer a great opportunity for homework or workbook help. If you feel Fiona would benefit from more personalized support, please feel free to book up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find a detailed report of her in-class performance here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5YAG.

This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when the digits don\\u2019t share the same place values, along with some engaging math puzzles involving decimal operations. Jasper was very engaged and attentive throughout the class, consistently keeping his camera on, which really helped his participation.\\n\\nJasper answered 11 questions in class, getting 9 correct, 1 partially correct (question #5), and 1 incorrect (question #10). These two questions are good targets for us to review together to strengthen his understanding. His careful attention in class is a strong foundation to build on.\\n\\nFor homework, Jasper scored 92% on the assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line vs. bar graphs. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to deepen his grasp of these concepts.\\n\\nTo support Jasper further, he can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems if requested. Also, please remind him that I hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework or workbook questions. If he would benefit from more personalized guidance, he has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Jasper\\u2019s in-class performance in this report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXzpQ.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Mandi,\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Damon\\u2019s progress this week. He was engaged and attentive throughout our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, with his camera consistently on, which really helped maintain focus. Damon answered 9 in-class questions, getting 7 correct and 1 partially correct (question #6), and only left question #1 unanswered. This shows strong understanding with just a small opportunity for improvement on that partially correct question.\\n\\nFor homework, Damon scored 92% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. I encourage you to have Damon watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes he made to solidify his understanding.\\n\\nTo support his continued growth, Damon can work on extra problems in the workbook, especially those related to decimals and graph interpretation. If you feel he would benefit from extra help, please remind him about our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, or consider booking one of his free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Recordings of lessons and office hours are also available if he misses a live session.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Damon\\u2019s detailed in-class performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl40ro. I am happy to discuss any questions you have and look forward to supporting Damon\\u2019s continued success.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u66fc\\u8fea\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u8fbe\\u8499\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u4ed6\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u3002\\u8fbe\\u8499\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e869\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d7\\u9898\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c6\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u663e\\u793a\\u4ed6\\u5bf9\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8f83\\u597d\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u63d0\\u5347\\u7a7a\\u95f4\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0c\\u8fbe\\u8499\\u5728\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6216\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4e8692\\u5206\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u7763\\u4fc3\\u8fbe\\u8499\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u63d0\\u5347\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8ba9\\u8fbe\\u8499\\u591a\\u505a\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u6d89\\u53ca\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u548c\\u56fe\\u8868\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u7684\\u90e8\\u5206\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97\\u4ed6\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u4ed6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u4ed6\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u4e5f\\u90fd\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u56de\\u770b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u8fbe\\u8499\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff0c\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl40ro\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u7591\\u95ee\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\uff0c\\u6211\\u671f\\u5f85\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\u8fbe\\u8499\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\n\\u656c\\u793c  \\n\\u5965\\u9a6c\\u5c14\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Min Jie,\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Shane\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers where digits fall in different place values, along with solving some fun decimal puzzles. Shane answered only 1 out of 9 in-class questions and left 8 unanswered, specifically questions #1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7, #8, and #9. This was likely impacted by him arriving late and leaving early, missing a total of 35 minutes of class. I understand things can come up, but please encourage Shane to attend the full class time to benefit fully from the lessons.\\n\\nShane was noticeably distracted during class and often walked away from the screen. Encouraging him to stay focused and engaged, perhaps by sitting with him during lessons, could make a big difference. On a positive note, his camera was consistently on, showing good participation intent. Additionally, he experienced one disconnection, possibly during break time; ensuring stable internet and troubleshooting technical issues might help avoid this in the future. You can contact Think customer service if needed.\\n\\nRegarding homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Shane scored 69%. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to strengthen his understanding. There are also extra workbook problems available, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice if you request it. Remember, office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for extra help with homework and workbook problems. For more personalized support, you can book up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor a detailed view of Shane\\u2019s in-class performance, you can review the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JOwzgw.\\n\\nThank you for your support, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if I can assist further.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684Min Jie\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bShane\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u76f8\\u540c\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b57\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002Shane\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u603b\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e869\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\u4e2d\\u76841\\u9053\\uff0c\\u53e6\\u59168\\u9053\\u9898\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u30012\\u30013\\u30014\\u30016\\u30017\\u30018\\u548c9\\u9898\\uff09\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u7531\\u4e8e\\u4ed6\\u8fdf\\u5230\\u5e76\\u63d0\\u524d\\u79bb\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e8635\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u5bfc\\u81f4\\u4ed6\\u672a\\u80fd\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u7684\\u539f\\u56e0\\u4e4b\\u4e00\\u3002\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7279\\u6b8a\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u8bf7\\u9f13\\u52b1Shane\\u5c3d\\u91cf\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u8bfe\\u5802\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5145\\u5206\\u5438\\u6536\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0cShane\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u660e\\u663e\\u7684\\u5206\\u5fc3\\uff0c\\u7ecf\\u5e38\\u79bb\\u5f00\\u5c4f\\u5e55\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u5728\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u671f\\u95f4\\u966a\\u4f34\\u4ed6\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u3002\\u503c\\u5f97\\u80af\\u5b9a\\u7684\\u662f\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u663e\\u793a\\u51fa\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u7684\\u610f\\u613f\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u65f6\\u51fa\\u73b0\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u4f11\\u606f\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u9020\\u6210\\u7684\\u3002\\u8bf7\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u7a33\\u5b9a\\u5e76\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\u53ef\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u534f\\u52a9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u4e3b\\u9898\\u662f\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0cShane\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a69%\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u8ba9\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u6790\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u4ee5\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e60\\u9898\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u4f7f\\u7528\\uff0c\\u82e5\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think\\u5b66\\u751f\\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fceShane\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u4ee5\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bShane\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JOwzgw\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

He showed great engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson, keeping his camera on consistently, which really contributed to his active participation.\\n\\nDuring our session on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, Vivaan answered 11 questions in class, getting 10 correct and only missing question #10. This is a strong performance, and it\\u2019s clear he understands the material well, though reviewing that one question together could help solidify his grasp of the concepts.\\n\\nFor homework, Vivaan scored 92% on the assignment involving plotting and interpreting line graphs and trend lines. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and strengthen his understanding.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Yue,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Chelsea\\u2019s progress during this week\\u2019s math lesson. Chelsea engaged attentively throughout the class, keeping her camera on and participating actively, which is wonderful to see. She answered 11 in-class questions, correctly solving 8 of them. However, she struggled a bit with questions #10 and #11, and did not answer question #1, which may be related to her arriving slightly late to class. I understand that sometimes unexpected things happen, and I encourage your support in helping Chelsea attend on time to ensure she doesn\\u2019t miss important early content.\\n\\nHer homework score was 88%, a solid performance. I recommend encouraging Chelsea to watch the homework solution video to review any errors and strengthen her understanding. This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimals with different place values, and solving related math puzzles\\u2014skills that can be tricky but are essential building blocks.\\n\\nChelsea had one brief disconnection during class, possibly during the break. To avoid missing any important moments, please ensure her connection is stable; if needed, Think\\u2019s customer service can assist with technical issues.\\n\\nIf Chelsea would like extra practice, she can try additional problems in the workbook or request more. Also, she is welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help. Should you feel Chelsea would benefit from one-on-one attention, you can book up to three free tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Chelsea\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JmeZAA.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Ava,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some updates on Maxi\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits aren\\u2019t in the same place values, along with solving some fun math puzzles involving these skills.\\n\\nMaxi participated actively and kept his camera on throughout the lesson, showing good engagement. He answered 11 questions in class, getting 8 correct but leaving questions #5, #9, and #10 unanswered. These particular questions might be good points for additional review to boost his confidence and understanding.\\n\\nHe attended 78 minutes of the 90-minute class but experienced three disconnections, possibly linked to the break. To support his continuous learning, please ensure his attendance is uninterrupted as much as possible, and feel free to reach out to Think\\u2019s customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nRegarding homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Maxi scored 92%, which is excellent. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video again to address any small errors and deepen his understanding.\\n\\nFor extra practice, Maxi can work on supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems on request. Also, please remind him about our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework help. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if he can\\u2019t attend live.\\n\\nIf Maxi would benefit from personalized attention, remember he has access to up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester. You can book these sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on Maxi\\u2019s in-class performance, you can view the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96x07b.

I wanted to reach out with some wonderful news about Emilia's progress this week in math class.\\n\\nEmilia has been doing excellent work with decimal addition and subtraction. She answered 11 questions during our lessons this week and got 9 of them correct\\u2014that's an 82% accuracy rate on in-class questions, which shows real understanding of the material. I was particularly impressed by her engagement and focus; she kept her camera on throughout and was actively participating in our discussions about aligning decimals and solving those fun decimal puzzles.\\n\\nI did notice that Emilia had a bit of difficulty with Question #11, and Question #10 was partially correct. These are great learning opportunities! I'd encourage her to review these specific questions and think about where the alignment or calculation might have gone differently.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Emilia scored 92% on her line graph assignment\\u2014fantastic work! She's clearly grasping how to plot and interpret data. I do recommend that she watch the homework solution video and take time to correct any mistakes from that assignment.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Linda,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share April\\u2019s progress from this week's math lesson, where we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers even when their place values don\\u2019t line up, along with solving some engaging math puzzles using decimal operations.\\n\\nApril was engaged and attentive throughout the class and kept her camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see. She answered 10 out of 11 questions correctly, with only the last question (#11) left unanswered. I noticed she missed the very beginning of class and arrived a minute late, which might explain why she didn\\u2019t answer that final question. I understand things can come up, but if you could encourage April to join on time, it would help her make the most of each lesson. Additionally, April experienced one disconnection during class, possibly around the break. Please ensure her connection is stable, and if technical issues persist, feel free to reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nApril\\u2019s previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs vs. bar graphs was scored at 100%. She is encouraged to watch the homework solution video to reinforce her understanding and correct any minor errors if they arise.\\n\\nTo support April further, she can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Chris,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Yilan\\u2019s progress this week in our math class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits are not in the same place values, along with solving some engaging math puzzles using those skills.\\n\\nYilan was attentive and engaged throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on consistently, which I really appreciate. She answered 11 in-class questions, with 7 correct, but she had some difficulty with questions #2, #3, and #11, and did not answer question #10. These particular questions might benefit from some extra review to build her confidence and accuracy.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Yilan scored 76% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. To help improve her understanding and boost her score, I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and revisit any errors she made.\\n\\nFor additional practice, she can work on extra problems in the supplemental workbook, and I am happy to provide more problems upon request. Also, please remind Yilan that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for any homework or workbook questions. If she would benefit from more personalized support, she has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Yilan\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JMDVQL.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jon,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Travis\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math lessons. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits do not share the same place values, along with some fun math puzzles using these skills.\\n\\nTravis showed good engagement and kept his camera on consistently, which positively contributed to his participation. He answered 11 questions during class, with 3 correct and 2 incorrect responses, specifically on questions #3 and #6. He left several questions unanswered (#1, #4, #5, #8, #9, #10), which suggests he might benefit from additional practice to build confidence in this area.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Travis scored 85% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs and drawing trend lines. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and reinforce his understanding.\\n\\nTo support Travis further, I recommend he work on extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and please feel free to request additional practice problems if needed. Also, he is welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework help. If you feel he would benefit from more personalized attention, there are up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester available, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Travis\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JPaWnM.\\n\\nPlease don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if I can assist in any way to support Travis\\u2019s continued growth in math.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Jon\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bTravis\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5f53\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u65f6\\u5982\\u4f55\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u8ba1\\u7b97\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u6765\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002  \\n\\nTravis\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u542f\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5bf9\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5f88\\u6709\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d3\\u9898\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c2\\u9898\\u7b54\\u9519\\uff0c\\u5177\\u4f53\\u662f\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c6\\u9898\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u6709\\u51e0\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u30014\\u30015\\u30018\\u30019\\u300110\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u90e8\\u5206\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u4e0a\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u6765\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cTravis\\u5728\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u4e8685\\u5206\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u9519\\u8bef\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301Travis\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u968f\\u65f6\\u5411\\u6211\\u7d22\\u53d6\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u4e60\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u7591\\u95ee\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97\\u4ed6\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6bcf\\u4f4d\\u5b66\\u751f\\u67093\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u7684\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8eTravis\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u8fd9\\u4efd\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JPaWnM\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u7591\\u95ee\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\uff0c\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u652f\\u6301Travis\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u4e0d\\u65ad\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

I\\u2019m pleased to see Isabella\\u2019s strong grasp of these concepts so far.\\n\\nFor homework, Isabella scored a perfect 100% on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. To reinforce her learning, please encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct any minor mistakes she may have made.\\n\\nIf Isabella would like extra practice, there are supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Joyce,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Chelsea has had a strong week in class, showing great engagement and attentiveness throughout our lessons. She consistently kept her camera on, which helps maintain focus and participation. During our recent class on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, Chelsea answered 11 questions, getting 10 correct and only missing one on question #11. This indicates a solid understanding of the material, and I am confident she can master this fully with a bit more practice.\\n\\nChelsea also completed her homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs perfectly, scoring 100%. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to reinforce concepts and help her self-correct any minor mistakes she might notice. If Chelsea would like additional practice, extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide more upon request.\\n\\nTo support Chelsea\\u2019s continued progress, please remind her that office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get extra help on homework or workbook problems. Also, remember she can book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester using this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor a more detailed view of Chelsea\\u2019s in-class performance, you can review the full report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWzVm.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Tina,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Anna\\u2019s progress in class this week. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits do not line up in the same place values, along with solving engaging math puzzles related to this topic.\\n\\nAnna answered 11 in-class questions; she got 4 correct, 4 partially correct (questions #1, #5, #6, and #8), 1 incorrect (#11), and did not answer 2 (#7 and #10). It seems that some of the unanswered and later questions may have been affected by Anna leaving class about 18 minutes early. I understand things can come up, but I encourage ensuring she stays until the end of the 90-minute session to fully benefit from all material and practice.\\n\\nAnna was engaged and attentive throughout, with her camera consistently on, which is wonderful. However, she experienced 8 disconnections during class, one likely due to the break. Please consider checking her internet connection or contacting Think customer service if needed to help maintain continuous attendance.\\n\\nRegarding homework on line graphs and trend lines, Anna scored 81%. I recommend she watches the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes. For additional practice, there are extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide more problems upon request.\\n\\nIf you feel Anna could benefit from extra support, please feel free to book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Anna\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/R5QWBY. Please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if I can support Anna further.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Tina\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bAnna\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u662f\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u7279\\u522b\\u662f\\u5f53\\u6570\\u5b57\\u4e0d\\u5728\\u76f8\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u540c\\u65f6\\u8fd8\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u4e0e\\u6b64\\u76f8\\u5173\\u7684\\u6709\\u8da3\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\nAnna\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d4\\u9898\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c4\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u30015\\u30016\\u548c8\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c1\\u9898\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u67092\\u9898\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c7\\u548c10\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u672a\\u7b54\\u9898\\u548c\\u540e\\u671f\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u56e0\\u4e3aAnna\\u63d0\\u524d\\u79bb\\u5f00\\u4e86\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u7ea618\\u5206\\u949f\\u9020\\u6210\\u7684\\u3002\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7279\\u6b8a\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5c3d\\u91cf\\u8ba9\\u5979\\u575a\\u6301\\u5b8c\\u6574\\u768490\\u5206\\u949f\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5145\\u5206\\u638c\\u63e1\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\nAnna\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u79ef\\u6781\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5ea6\\u9ad8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u5979\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u65f6\\u7ecf\\u5386\\u4e868\\u6b21\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u4f11\\u606f\\u65f6\\u5bfc\\u81f4\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u68c0\\u67e5\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u8fde\\u63a5\\uff0c\\u5fc5\\u8981\\u65f6\\u53ef\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u5bfb\\u6c42\\u6280\\u672f\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u5979\\u80fd\\u6301\\u7eed\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u53ca\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u503c\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cAnna\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a81%\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Anna\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e2a\\u522b\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bAnna\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/R5QWBY\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Helena has shown great engagement and attentiveness in class this week, consistently keeping her camera on and actively participating. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values, as well as solving some fun math puzzles using these skills. Helena answered nine questions during class, with 5 fully correct, 3 partially correct (questions #2, #6, and #8), and only one incorrect (#9). This shows she is progressing well, though there is a small opportunity to review those particular questions to strengthen her understanding.\\n\\nFor homework, Helena achieved an excellent score of 100% on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including trend lines and their applications. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to reinforce her learning and correct any minor mistakes she might have missed.\\n\\nTo support Helena\\u2019s growth, she might benefit from additional practice with the extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, which focus on decimals and graphing. If you would like, I can also provide more problems tailored to her needs.

It will happen in the same room as the lesson, so you can just sit with your child after class. Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Qiang,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Benjamin has been demonstrating great engagement and attentiveness during our recent lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, even when the digits do not line up by place value. He kept his camera consistently on and actively participated, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nOut of the 11 questions he answered in class, Benjamin correctly solved 9 but struggled with questions #5 and #11. These particular problems offered a bit more challenge, so I recommend reviewing those together to reinforce his understanding. Additionally, his recent homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs scored an impressive 95%. To help him improve even further, please encourage him to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes he made.\\n\\nBenjamin can also benefit from extra practice with the supplemental workbook problems, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional exercises upon request. Remember, office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app if he needs help, and recordings are accessible for any sessions he misses. If you feel Benjamin would benefit from more personalized support, he is eligible for up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed insights into Benjamin\\u2019s performance, please feel free to review the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jp5yW6.

This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, including solving some engaging math puzzles related to the topic.\\n\\nGrace has been engaged and attentive during class, consistently keeping her camera on, which is wonderful to see. Out of the 16 in-class questions, she answered 5 correctly and missed only one (Question 16). The other 10 questions marked as unanswered are actually Graffiti Posts, which are informal and ungraded contributions\\u2014Grace\\u2019s thoughtful submissions there are visible in her lesson report. This shows she is participating in different ways beyond just graded questions.\\n\\nHer previous homework score was strong at 92%. I encourage you to have Grace watch the homework solution video; it\\u2019s a great way for her to review and correct any small mistakes. To support her further, she can practice extra problems in the workbook or request additional exercises if she wants more challenge.\\n\\nIf you feel Grace would benefit from more personalized guidance, please remember that up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester are available, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Also, office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a helpful resource for homework and workbook questions.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review more details about Grace\\u2019s performance in the in-class report linked here: https://student-h5.thethinkacademy.com/learningReport?studentId=8243657&classId=88234&planId=464981&schoolCode=415&report_log_id=-1&skey=7429ab4682fb0b8f1458d4492a297b52.1765226327290\\n\\nThank you for your ongoing support.

She participated actively during our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, correctly answering 8 out of 9 in-class questions. The only question she left unanswered was question #8, which might be a good area to review together. Her consistent use of the camera also shows strong focus and readiness to learn.\\n\\nAimee\\u2019s previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs was excellent, scoring 100%. To help reinforce these skills, I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and check her work carefully to catch any small mistakes she might find.\\n\\nTo support Aimee\\u2019s continued progress, she may benefit from extra practice with supplemental problems in the workbook, especially on decimals. Please feel free to request additional problems if you think she would enjoy more challenge.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Tina has shown great engagement and attentiveness in class this week, consistently keeping her camera on and actively participating in our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values. She answered 11 questions in class, getting 9 correct, 1 partially correct (question #10), and 1 incorrect (question #11). These last two questions seem to be areas where she could use a little extra practice to solidify her understanding.\\n\\nHer previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs earned her a perfect score of 100%. I encourage Tina to watch the homework solution video to reinforce these concepts and to help her correct any minor misunderstandings.\\n\\nTo support her continued progress, I recommend she practice some extra problems from the supplemental workbook, especially those related to decimal operations, which we covered in class. Additionally, Tina can attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework or workbook help. If you feel she would benefit from more personalized attention, please consider booking one of the up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can also review her detailed in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JeZ5YQ.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support in Tina\\u2019s learning journey.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Rachel,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Lucas demonstrated strong engagement and attentiveness during this week's lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, keeping his camera on throughout class. He answered 11 questions in class, getting 8 correct, 1 partially correct (question #10), 1 incorrect (question #11), and leaving 1 unanswered (question #5). These last three questions suggest a few spots where he could benefit from additional review and practice to strengthen his understanding.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed Lucas did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. Completing this homework will be important for him to solidify those concepts and prepare for upcoming lessons. Please encourage him to complete homework on time, and I am happy to support him with extra problems from the workbook or additional practice upon request.\\n\\nTo further assist Lucas, I recommend he attend our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help on homework or workbook questions. Additionally, I want to remind you that up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available this semester; you can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Lucas\\u2019s in-class performance in this report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jxo867.

He was fully engaged, attentive, and kept his camera on throughout the class, which is wonderful to see. Jesse did miss 3 minutes of the 90-minute session due to two brief disconnections\\u2014one likely during the break. To help ensure he doesn\\u2019t miss any content, I encourage you to check his internet connection or reach out to Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Jesse scored 85% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs and using trend lines. This is a solid performance, and reviewing the homework solution video together could help him correct any mistakes and deepen his understanding. For additional practice, supplemental workbook problems are available, and I\\u2019m happy to provide more problems upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Jesse that office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, which can be a great opportunity for extra help.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear April,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Amy\\u2019s progress in math this week. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits do not share the same place values, along with solving some engaging math puzzles using these skills. Amy participated actively, keeping her camera on and remaining attentive throughout the lesson, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nIn class, she answered 11 questions, with 9 correct, 1 partially correct (question #5), and 1 incorrect (question #11). These specific questions may benefit from some review to strengthen her understanding. Unfortunately, Amy did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and distinguishing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Encouraging her to complete this will help solidify these important concepts and keep her on track.\\n\\nTo support her further, Amy can access extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems if needed. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are also available for homework or workbook help, and recordings of classes and office hours can be reviewed anytime. Additionally, Amy has up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Amy\\u2019s detailed performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JZgDXN. I\\u2019m confident that with continued effort and support, Amy will continue to make excellent progress. Thank you for partnering with me in her learning journey.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684April\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bAmy\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u76f8\\u52a0/\\u76f8\\u51cf\\u5728\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u4e0a\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u6570\\u5b57\\u7684\\u5341\\u8fdb\\u5236\\u6570\\uff0c\\u540c\\u65f6\\u8fd8\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u6765\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002Amy\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u6253\\u5f00\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5e76\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6b23\\u6170\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0cAmy\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d9\\u9898\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e24\\u4e2a\\u5177\\u4f53\\u9898\\u53f7\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1Amy\\u590d\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5f3a\\u5316\\u5979\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u80fd\\u529b\\u3002\\u9057\\u61be\\u7684\\u662f\\uff0cAmy\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u91cd\\u8981\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\uff0cAmy\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u7ebf\\u4e0a\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e3a\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\uff0c\\u901a\\u8fc7Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u8fdb\\u884c\\uff0c\\u4e3b\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u4e60\\u9898\\u518c\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u7684\\u5f55\\u5236\\u89c6\\u9891\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u968f\\u65f6\\u56de\\u770b\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0cAmy\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bAmy\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JZgDXN\\u3002\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u5728\\u6301\\u7eed\\u52aa\\u529b\\u548c\\u652f\\u6301\\u4e0b\\uff0cAmy\\u4f1a\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u5927\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u643a\\u624b\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\n\\u656c\\u793c\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, especially when the digits are not in the same place values, and also enjoyed solving some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations. Jennifer was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson and kept her camera on consistently, which helped maintain good focus.  \\n\\nDuring class, she answered 9 questions, with 5 correct answers. She struggled a bit with questions #6 and #9, and did not answer #3 and #8. These indicate some areas where she could benefit from extra practice to build confidence with the material.  \\n\\nJennifer\\u2019s homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs earned a strong score of 92%. To further improve, I encourage Jennifer to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes she made.  \\n\\nTo support her growth, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share an update on Yunxi\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. She has been very engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, consistently keeping her camera on, which positively contributes to her focus. During our work on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, Yunxi answered 11 in-class questions, getting 10 correct and only one incorrect \\u2014 specifically question #11. This shows she is grasping the concepts well, though reviewing that particular question could help solidify her understanding.  \\n\\nYunxi also completed the recent homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, scoring a perfect 100%. To deepen her understanding, I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video and correct any minor mistakes she might notice.  \\n\\nFor additional practice, Yunxi can work on extra problems in the supplemental workbook, and I am happy to provide more problems upon request. Also, please remind her that I hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework or workbook questions. All class and office hour sessions are recorded in case she cannot attend live.  \\n\\nIf Yunxi would benefit from more personalized support, she is entitled to up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester. You can book these sessions directly here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find detailed information about her in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1NpK5. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there is any other way I can support Yunxi\\u2019s learning.  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bYunxi\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u3002\\u5728\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u76f8\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u5341\\u8fdb\\u5236\\u6570\\u5b57\\u65f6\\uff0cYunxi\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d10\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u4e00\\u9053\\uff08\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\uff09\\u7b54\\u9519\\u4e86\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u597d\\uff0c\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\u590d\\u4e60\\u90a3\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002  \\n\\nYunxi\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e86\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4e3a\\u6ee1\\u5206100%\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u8ba9\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u5b58\\u5728\\u7684\\u7ec6\\u5fae\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0cYunxi\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u53e6\\u5916\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u5979\\u6211\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6240\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u90fd\\u6709\\u5f55\\u5236\\uff0c\\u65b9\\u4fbf\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u7684\\u5b66\\u751f\\u56de\\u770b\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cYunxi\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u76f4\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1NpK5\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

I wanted to share some feedback about Emma\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers. Emma attended most of the class, missing about 11 minutes, which may explain why she did not answer the earlier questions (#1 and #5). She arrived a bit late, and I understand that sometimes unexpected things can come up; please help encourage her to join on time to maximize her learning.\\n\\nDuring class, Emma answered nine questions, with three correct and two partially correct (questions #3 and #4), but she struggled with questions #8 and #9, and left two questions unanswered (#1 and #5). Her engagement remained strong throughout, and she kept her camera on consistently, which was wonderful to see.\\n\\nFor homework, Emma scored 96% on the recent assignment about line graphs and trend lines. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to reinforce her understanding and correct any minor mistakes. To support her further, there are extra supplemental workbook problems available, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems if needed. Emma is also welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for help, and recordings are available if she cannot attend live.\\n\\nIf you feel Emma would benefit from more personalized support, remember that up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions are available this semester; you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review her detailed performance in the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yomz0. Thank you for your continued partnership in supporting Emma\\u2019s progress. I look forward to seeing her growth next week.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bEmma\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u8fd0\\u7b97\\u3002Emma\\u51e0\\u4e4e\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u4e86\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u5927\\u7ea611\\u5206\\u949f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u5bfc\\u81f4\\u5979\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u65f6\\u7a0d\\u5fae\\u8fdf\\u5230\\uff0c\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7a81\\u53d1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u53d1\\u751f\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u60a8\\u5e2e\\u5fd9\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u6309\\u65f6\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5145\\u5206\\u5229\\u7528\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0cEmma\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e869\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d3\\u9898\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c2\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c4\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c8\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c9\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u672a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u4e00\\u4efd\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a96%\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u8ba9Emma\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u7ec6\\u5fae\\u9519\\u8bef\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u4e60\\u9898\\u518c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002Emma\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u82e5\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Emma\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6709\\u5173\\u5979\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yomz0\\u3002\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u5bf9Emma\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u671f\\u5f85\\u5979\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u5927\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Andy has been very engaged and attentive during class, consistently keeping his camera on, which really helps maintain focus. This week, we worked on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when the digits do not share the same place values, followed by some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations. Andy answered 10 out of 11 in-class questions correctly, showing strong understanding overall. The one question he struggled with was question #11, which we will revisit to ensure clarity.\\n\\nFor homework, Andy scored 77% on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review his mistakes and reinforce his skills. To support his learning further, please remind him that extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.\\n\\nAdditionally, Andy can benefit from office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app if he needs help with homework or workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also accessible for review.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Sophie,\\n\\nI\\u2019m pleased to share Chloe\\u2019s progress this week in our math class. She demonstrated strong engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on consistently, which really helps her focus and participate actively. In our recent topic on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values, Chloe answered 13 in-class questions, with 10 correct, 1 partially correct (Question #9), and 2 incorrect (Questions #10 and #12). These particular questions suggest a bit more practice could help solidify her understanding in some areas.\\n\\nChloe\\u2019s previous homework on interpreting and plotting line graphs earned her a perfect score of 100%, which is excellent. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to reinforce her skills and to help her correct any minor mistakes she might have made on her own. For further practice, she can explore extra supplemental problems in her workbook or request additional problems if she feels ready to challenge herself more.\\n\\nWe also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, a great opportunity for Chloe to get help on homework or workbook problems. Additionally, if you think Chloe would benefit from more personalized support, please consider booking up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Chloe\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JjLe5m.

She answered all 11 in-class questions correctly, showing strong mastery of the concepts and problem-solving skills, including the fun math puzzles we explored together. Elizabeth was attentive and kept her camera on throughout the class, which positively contributed to her focus.  \\n\\nRegarding her homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, as well as drawing trend lines for predictions and choosing appropriate graph types, Elizabeth scored 91%. This is a solid performance, and I recommend encouraging her to watch the homework solution video to review any minor errors and reinforce her understanding further.  \\n\\nTo support her continued progress, Elizabeth can benefit from extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, please remind her about the weekly office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook questions. If you feel she would benefit from more personalized attention, we offer up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nFor more detailed information about Elizabeth\\u2019s in-class performance, you can view the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZdqB.  \\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

He was absent from class, and I did not receive any notification from you. I understand that with Thanksgiving approaching, there may have been holiday events or travel plans that came up unexpectedly. If rescheduling or transferring class times would help accommodate your schedule, please let me know\\u2014we are happy to support you in this.\\n\\nSince Lionel missed the lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, I encourage him to review the material when possible. We have extra supplemental problems in the workbook that can reinforce these skills, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. Also, please remind Lionel to complete his homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, as well as drawing trend lines. He did not submit last week\\u2019s homework, and completing it will be important for his continued progress.\\n\\nTo support him further, our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework or workbook questions.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Matt,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Tiffany had an excellent week in class, demonstrating full engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson. She answered all 11 in-class questions correctly, showing a solid grasp of aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers even when the digits fall into different place values. It was a pleasure to see her participate actively with her camera consistently on, which helps maintain a great learning atmosphere.  \\n\\nFor homework, Tiffany scored a perfect 100% on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video if she wants to review or reinforce any steps, as this can deepen her understanding even further.  \\n\\nIf Tiffany would like extra practice, she can try the supplemental problems in the workbook, or I would be happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, please remind her that office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook help. For more personalized support, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester are available and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Tiffany\\u2019s performance in this week\\u2019s lesson in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RkqxEX.  \\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss Tiffany\\u2019s progress further.  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684Matt\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002Tiffany\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u51fa\\u8272\\uff0c\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u3002\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86\\u6240\\u670911\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5168\\u90e8\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u5c55\\u73b0\\u4e86\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u548c\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u770b\\u5230\\u5979\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8425\\u9020\\u4e86\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u6c1b\\u56f4\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cTiffany\\u5728\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5305\\u62ec\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u548c\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4efb\\u52a1\\u4e2d\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u6ee1\\u5206100%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u9898\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u6216\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cTiffany\\u60f3\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u6c42\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u540c\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u82e5\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u67e5\\u770bTiffany\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RkqxEX\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u7591\\u95ee\\u6216\\u60f3\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u8ba8\\u8bbaTiffany\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Ruima,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Madelyn had a strong week in class, showing great engagement and attentiveness, and consistently keeping her camera on, which really helps with focus. She answered 11 questions during the lesson and got 10 correct, with just one question (#6) answered incorrectly. This shows solid understanding of the material, though a quick review of that question could be beneficial.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits fall in different place values, and Madelyn participated actively in solving some fun math puzzles related to this. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video for her recent assignment on line graphs, trend lines, and their applications, as she scored 88%. Reviewing this video can help her correct any mistakes and deepen her understanding.\\n\\nIf Madelyn wants extra practice, there are supplemental problems in the workbook she can try, and I\\u2019m happy to provide more upon request. Additionally, she can join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework help. If you feel Madelyn would benefit from more individualized support, please consider booking one of the up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester at the link below.\\n\\nYou can also view a detailed report of her in-class performance here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5z6w\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can assist Madelyn further.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nhttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Ruima\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002Madelyn\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u51fa\\u8272\\uff0c\\u5979\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u4e14\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5bf9\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5f88\\u5927\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d10\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u7b2c6\\u9898\\u7b54\\u9519\\u4e86\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8bf4\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u6240\\u5b66\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u597d\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u56de\\u987e\\u90a3\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u3002\\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5728\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u4e0b\\u5bf9\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u53ca\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u8fd0\\u7b97\\uff0cMadelyn\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u4e86\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u76f8\\u5173\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u662f\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u53ca\\u5176\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u5e94\\u7528\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4e8688%\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cMadelyn\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u901a\\u8fc7Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Madelyn\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u89c1\\u4e0b\\u65b9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5z6w\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\\n\\nhttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Bryson had a strong week in class, showing great engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson. He consistently kept his camera on, which helped maintain his focus. During our activities on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, Bryson answered 11 questions in class, with 9 correct responses. He struggled with questions 10 and 11, leaving one unanswered and one incorrect. These are areas we can work on together to help him gain more confidence.\\n\\nBryson\\u2019s previous homework score was 85%, demonstrating good understanding overall. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes, as this will solidify his grasp of plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and deciding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nTo support Bryson further, he can practice extra problems in the supplemental workbook or request additional problems if he wants more challenge.

He showed excellent understanding during our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values. Josiah answered all 11 in-class questions correctly, demonstrating strong mastery of the material. He was fully engaged throughout class and kept his camera consistently on, which really helped maintain his focus.\\n\\nFor homework, Josiah scored 92% on the assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs and drawing trend lines. This is a solid result, though I encourage him to watch the homework solution video and review any mistakes to deepen his understanding. If Josiah would like extra practice, there are supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional exercises upon request.\\n\\nPlease remember that Josiah can also join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app if he needs help with homework or workbook questions. Additionally, he has access to up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester, which you can book anytime here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Josiah\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vzo6ed.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Leo demonstrated excellent understanding of how to align and add or subtract decimal numbers even when digits do not share the same place values. He answered all 11 in-class questions correctly and was fully engaged with his camera on throughout the lesson, which is wonderful to see. His attentiveness really contributed to his strong performance.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Leo scored 85% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. To help him improve further, I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video and review any mistakes he made. This will reinforce his learning and boost his confidence for future assignments.\\n\\nIf Leo would like extra practice, we have supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, please remind him that I hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help on homework or workbook questions. For more personalized support, Leo can book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Leo\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vQX3Db.

I wanted to share some encouraging feedback about Siyan\\u2019s progress in math this week. She demonstrated excellent focus and engagement during our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values. Out of 12 in-class questions, Siyan answered 11 correctly and had just one partially correct response on question #6, showing a strong grasp of the material overall. Her consistent attentiveness and having her camera on throughout class also contributed positively to her learning experience.  \\n\\nRegarding homework, Siyan earned a solid score of 95% on the recent assignment involving line graphs and trend lines. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to review any small mistakes she may have made, which will reinforce her understanding.  \\n\\nIf Siyan would like to deepen her skills, she can try extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems. We also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook support. For personalized assistance, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available this semester and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nPlease feel free to review the detailed performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/J31byl.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Peggy,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Wilson has shown great engagement and attentiveness during this week's lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, and he consistently kept his camera on, which positively contributed to his focus. Out of 12 in-class questions, he answered 10 correctly, was partially correct on question #5, and had difficulty with question #12. These two questions could be good starting points for additional practice to strengthen his understanding.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Wilson did not complete last week's assignment on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and distinguishing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Completing this homework will be important for consolidating his skills, and I encourage him to submit future assignments on time to keep pace with the class.\\n\\nTo support Wilson\\u2019s progress, he is welcome to work on extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I can provide additional tailored problems upon request. Office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework or workbook questions. Also, we offer up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if he needs to revisit any lessons.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Wilson\\u2019s detailed performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/voG104. I\\u2019m confident with a bit more practice on the challenging questions and consistent homework completion, Wilson will continue to excel.

This level of focus is wonderful to see.\\n\\nStephanie did miss about 3 minutes of class due to two brief disconnections, one possibly related to the break. To help her avoid missing content, please ensure her connection is stable during lessons. If needed, Think customer service can provide technical support.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Stephanie earned an 85% on the recent assignment about line graphs and trend lines.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. This week in class, Sarah did an excellent job staying engaged and attentive, with her camera consistently on, which really contributed to her focus. She answered 12 in-class questions, getting 10 correct and leaving questions #11 and #12 unanswered. These last two questions could be good areas for her to revisit to strengthen her understanding. \\n\\nWe covered how to align and add or subtract decimals when the digits do not line up by place value, along with some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations. Sarah participated actively and showed strong comprehension overall.\\n\\nHer recent homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and knowing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs, earned a perfect score of 100%. I encourage you to have Sarah watch the homework solution video to reinforce her learning and double-check her work.\\n\\nTo support her further, additional problems are available in the supplemental workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide more practice questions upon request. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great opportunity for Sarah to get extra help with homework or workbook material. For more personalized support, Sarah can also book up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Sarah\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97MZyQ.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Dominic has been engaged and attentive in class this week, consistently keeping his camera on, which is wonderful to see. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits do not share the same place values, along with solving some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations.\\n\\nDominic answered 12 questions in class, with 6 correct, 1 partially correct, and 5 incorrect. Specifically, he struggled with questions #8, #9, #10, #11, and #12, and had a partial success on question #6. These results suggest that while he is grasping some concepts, there is room for improvement in applying decimal addition and subtraction in more complex contexts.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Dominic scored 62% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and knowing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I recommend encouraging him to watch the homework solution video and review his mistakes to better understand the material.\\n\\nTo support Dominic\\u2019s progress, he can work on extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. Our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. Recordings of classes and office hours are also accessible if he cannot attend live. Additionally, Dominic is eligible for up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed insights into Dominic\\u2019s performance, you may review the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9V6z2W.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\uff0cDominic\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u662f\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u5f53\\u6570\\u5b57\\u5728\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u4e0a\\u65f6\\u7684\\u5904\\u7406\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u540c\\u65f6\\u8fd8\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u6765\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u3002\\n\\nDominic\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d6\\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c5\\u4e2a\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u7279\\u522b\\u662f\\u5728\\u7b2c8\\u30019\\u300110\\u300111\\u548c12\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u7b2c6\\u9898\\u5219\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u5bf9\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u5df2\\u6709\\u638c\\u63e1\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5728\\u66f4\\u590d\\u6742\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u5e94\\u7528\\u65b9\\u9762\\u4ecd\\u9700\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cDominic\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6216\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u4e8662\\u5206\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u9898\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u4ee5\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u5e2e\\u52a9Dominic\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u665a\\u4e0a5\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u901a\\u8fc7Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\uff0c\\u4e13\\u95e8\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u82e5\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u7684\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u56de\\u653e\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0cDominic\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u67e5\\u770bDominic\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u70b9\\u51fb\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9V6z2W\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff01  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

I understand things can come up, but I kindly encourage your help in supporting her punctual attendance to maximize her learning time.\\n\\nCharlotte had one disconnection during class, possibly related to the break. To avoid interruptions, please check her technical setup and feel free to contact Think customer service if needed.  \\n\\nRegarding homework on line graphs and trend lines, Charlotte did not complete it last week. Completing homework on time is important for reinforcing concepts, so I encourage her to finish it soon.

It will happen in the same room as the lesson, so you can just sit with your child after class. Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share some feedback on Eva\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math lesson, where we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values and solving related puzzles.\\n\\nEva attended most of the class but missed 9 minutes and experienced four disconnections, one possibly due to the break. I understand that sometimes unexpected things happen; however, arriving on time and minimizing technical interruptions will help Eva engage fully from the start of class, especially since she did not answer questions #1, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9, #10, and #11, which were earlier in the lesson. She attempted questions #2, #3, #7, and #12 but answered all of them incorrectly. I appreciate that Eva remained engaged, attentive, and kept her camera on throughout, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Eva did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on line graphs and trend lines. I encourage her to complete it soon, as timely homework supports reinforcing classroom learning. Please remind her of the importance of submitting homework on time.\\n\\nTo support Eva\\u2019s progress, I recommend she try additional practice problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide more upon request. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great resource for any questions or homework help. If Eva feels she needs extra support, she can book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nFor more detailed information on Eva\\u2019s in-class performance, you can review the full report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9LnzbO.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

I wanted to check in regarding Yifeng\\u2019s attendance for this week\\u2019s lesson on adding and subtracting decimals with misaligned place values. I noticed he was absent, and I hadn\\u2019t received prior notice. I completely understand that things come up, especially with Thanksgiving just around the corner\\u2014holiday events or travel plans might have been the reason. Please know that if you need help rescheduling or transferring class times, I\\u2019m happy to assist.\\n\\nAlthough Yifeng missed the lesson, he can still keep up by reviewing the homework, which focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and deciding when line graphs or bar graphs are best. His previous homework score was strong at 92%, which is great to see. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to help correct any small mistakes and reinforce understanding.\\n\\nTo support his catch-up, there are extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I can provide additional practice problems if needed. Also, remind Yifeng that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also accessible if he can\\u2019t attend live. Should you feel Yifeng would benefit from more personalized help, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester are available, and you can easily book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out anytime if you have questions or need further support.

Tyler has been engaged and attentive in class this week, and it\\u2019s wonderful to see him keeping his camera on consistently. During our lessons on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits don\\u2019t share the same place values, Tyler answered 12 questions in class. He correctly solved 3, partially answered 3, but struggled with questions #1, #8, and #12, where he answered incorrectly, and left #4, #9, and #11 unanswered. These specific questions seem to be areas where additional practice could help reinforce his understanding.  \\n\\nTyler\\u2019s previous homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and comparing graph types earned him an 84%, which is solid progress. I encourage Tyler to watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and strengthen his skills in this area.  \\n\\nTo support Tyler\\u2019s learning, he might benefit from extra practice problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, please remind him that our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great opportunity to get help with homework or workbook questions.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Rachel,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Audrey had a strong week in class as we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values. She answered 11 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, with only question #10 proving challenging. Audrey remained engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on consistently, which greatly supports her learning.\\n\\nShe missed 3 minutes of class due to two brief disconnections, possibly related to the break. To help Audrey maximize her learning time, I encourage ensuring stable connectivity during class. If technical issues persist, please feel free to reach out to Think customer service for assistance.\\n\\nRegarding homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs and predicting trends, Audrey did not complete the assignment this week. I kindly encourage her to complete it soon to reinforce her understanding. To support her, she can use extra supplemental problems available in the workbook or request additional practice problems. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT are a great opportunity for homework help, and recordings are available if she cannot attend live.\\n\\nShould Audrey benefit from more personalized guidance, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions are available this semester; you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can view a detailed report of Audrey\\u2019s in-class performance here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5pmM.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding Julia\\u2019s attendance for this week\\u2019s math class. She was absent, and I did not receive prior notification. I completely understand that things come up, especially with Thanksgiving just around the corner, which might have meant holiday events or travel plans for your family. If you find it helpful, we can certainly discuss rescheduling or transferring her class time to better fit your schedule.\\n\\nThis week, the class focused on how to align and add or subtract decimal numbers when their place values don\\u2019t match, and we also enjoyed solving some fun math puzzles using decimal addition and subtraction. Since Julia missed this lesson, I encourage her to review the homework topic on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Her previous homework score was 76%, so watching the homework solution video and correcting any mistakes would be a valuable step to strengthen her understanding.\\n\\nPlease remind Julia that there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems on request. We also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework and workbook questions. If attending live is difficult, recordings of classes and office hours are accessible anytime. Additionally, Julia is eligible for up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your attention, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there is any way I can support Julia\\u2019s learning journey. More detailed performance information is available in her in-class report.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u6c9f\\u901a\\u4e00\\u4e0bJulia\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u51fa\\u52e4\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u5979\\u8fd9\\u6b21\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u8bfe\\u5802\\uff0c\\u800c\\u4e14\\u6211\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u6536\\u5230\\u4e8b\\u5148\\u901a\\u77e5\\u3002\\u6211\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u7406\\u89e3\\u751f\\u6d3b\\u4e2d\\u603b\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7a81\\u53d1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4e34\\u8fd1\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u4eec\\u5bb6\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u6709\\u8282\\u65e5\\u6d3b\\u52a8\\u6216\\u65c5\\u884c\\u5b89\\u6392\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97\\u65b9\\u4fbf\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u91cd\\u65b0\\u5b89\\u6392\\u6216\\u8c03\\u6574\\u5979\\u7684\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u914d\\u5408\\u60a8\\u7684\\u65e5\\u7a0b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u662f\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u5728\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u4e00\\u81f4\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u4e0b\\uff0c\\u540c\\u65f6\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8fd8\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u3002\\u7531\\u4e8eJulia\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u8fd9\\u8282\\u8bfe\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5185\\u5bb9\\uff1a\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u5229\\u7528\\u5b83\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u5e94\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u800c\\u975e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a76%\\uff0c\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u4f1a\\u5bf9\\u5979\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u5f88\\u6709\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192Julia\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u4e50\\u610f\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u90fd\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u5979\\u5e26\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6765\\u6c42\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u97f3\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u968f\\u65f6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u3002\\u53e6\\u5916\\uff0cJulia\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u5173\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\u5979\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u60a8\\u67e5\\u9605\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\n\\u656c\\u793c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Zack has been engaged and attentive during this week\\u2019s lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, and he consistently kept his camera on, which is wonderful to see. He answered 12 in-class questions, getting 8 correct, 1 partially correct (Question #8), 1 incorrect (Question #12), and left 2 unanswered (Questions #9 and #11). These particular questions might be good areas for Zack to revisit to strengthen his understanding.\\n\\nZack missed about 4 minutes of class due to two brief disconnections, one possibly during the break. To help him benefit fully from each lesson, please ensure his attendance is continuous and consider troubleshooting any technical issues. If you need assistance, Think customer service is available to support you.\\n\\nAdditionally, Zack did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. Completing his homework on time will reinforce what we cover in class and boost his confidence. I encourage you to motivate him to finish this assignment soon.\\n\\nFor extra practice, Zack can work on supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Emily,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Ethan\\u2019s progress this week. He has been engaged and attentive during our lessons, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on consistently, which helps with his focus and participation.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits are not in the same place values, along with solving some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations. Ethan answered 10 in-class questions, correctly solving 7, with 1 partially correct and 2 incorrect. Specifically, he had some difficulty with questions #6 and #10, while question #1 was partially correct. These are great opportunities to review and reinforce those concepts with him.\\n\\nEthan missed 4 minutes of class due to a brief disconnection, possibly during the break. To ensure he doesn\\u2019t miss important instruction, please check his internet connection and feel free to contact Think customer service if any technical issues persist.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Ethan scored 81% on his recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs and using trend lines to predict values. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to review mistakes and deepen his understanding.\\n\\nFor additional support, Ethan can try extra problems in the workbook or request more practice problems. I also hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework help. If you feel Ethan would benefit from more personalized attention, please consider booking one of his up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Ethan\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl40Ao.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Emily\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bEthan\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u6b23\\u8d4f\\u4ed6\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u3002\\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u5c0f\\u6570\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u5f53\\u6570\\u5b57\\u4e0d\\u5728\\u76f8\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002Ethan\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8610\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d7\\u9898\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c2\\u9898\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u5177\\u4f53\\u6765\\u8bf4\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c6\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u590d\\u4e60\\u548c\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u597d\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\nEthan\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u77ed\\u6682\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e864\\u5206\\u949f\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u5728\\u4f11\\u606f\\u671f\\u95f4\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u907f\\u514d\\u4ed6\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u91cd\\u8981\\u5185\\u5bb9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u68c0\\u67e5\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u8fde\\u63a5\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u5bfb\\u6c42\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cEthan\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u53ca\\u5229\\u7528\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u5230\\u4e8681%\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0cEthan\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u6216\\u8bf7\\u6c42\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u6211\\u4f1a\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u5f00\\u8bbe\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u5982\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Ethan\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u67e5\\u770b\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl40Ao\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u7591\\u95ee\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Emily was absent from class during our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, and I did not receive prior notice about her absence. I understand that with Thanksgiving approaching, holiday events or travel plans might have come up unexpectedly. Please know that if you need to reschedule or transfer her class time, I\\u2019m happy to assist in making arrangements that work best for Emily and your family.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Emily did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. Completing this homework will be important for her to build foundational skills, so I encourage her to finish it as soon as possible and aim to submit future assignments on time. To support her catch-up and practice, we have extra workbook problems available and additional exercises I can provide upon request. Emily can also attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for help with homework or workbook questions. Additionally, recordings of classes and office hours are accessible if attending live sessions is difficult.\\n\\nPlease remember Emily has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. These sessions could be a great opportunity for personalized support on missed content or homework.\\n\\nI\\u2019m looking forward to seeing Emily back in class and helping her stay on track.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Xuehui,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share some feedback on Jericho\\u2019s progress this week in class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits don\\u2019t line up in the same place values, and also enjoyed solving some fun math puzzles involving decimal operations. Jericho answered 12 questions in class, with 9 correct, 1 incorrect (question #2), and 2 left unanswered (#1 and #12). He was engaged and attentive throughout, with his camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nJericho missed 2 minutes of class since he left a bit early. I understand sometimes things come up, but I encourage you to help him stay until the end of the full 90 minutes, as the unanswered questions may be related to leaving early.\\n\\nRegarding homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Jericho scored 81%. I recommend he watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to strengthen his understanding.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Yilia\\u2019s progress this week. She participated actively and attentively in class, keeping her camera on consistently, which helped maintain strong engagement. During our lesson on aligning and adding/subtracting decimals with differing place values, Yilia answered 12 questions: she got 8 fully correct and 2 partially correct (questions #5 and #8), with no incorrect answers but did not respond to questions #11 and #12. These unanswered questions might be good starting points for a little review to build her confidence further.\\n\\nFor homework, Yilia scored 92% on her assignment involving line graphs and trend lines, which is excellent. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to correct any small mistakes and reinforce her understanding. If she would like extra practice, there are supplemental workbook problems available, and I am happy to provide additional ones upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Yilia that our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework or workbook questions. Also, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions are available this semester, and you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Yilia\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JmeZXA. Overall, she is doing very well, and with a little extra focus on the questions she skipped, I am confident she will continue to grow.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bYilia\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u79ef\\u6781\\u4e14\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5730\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e86\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u53ca\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\uff0cYilia\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff1a\\u5176\\u4e2d8\\u9898\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c2\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c5\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c8\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u9519\\u8bef\\u7b54\\u6848\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e26\\u5979\\u56de\\u987e\\u8fd9\\u4e24\\u9053\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u81ea\\u4fe1\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cYilia\\u5728\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4e8692%\\u7684\\u9ad8\\u5206\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u51fa\\u8272\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u9898\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5c0f\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6559\\u8f85\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u9009\\u62e9\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u4e50\\u610f\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192Yilia\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u6bb5\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u5185\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u5979\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u67e5\\u9605Yilia\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JmeZXA\\u3002\\u603b\\u4f53\\u6765\\u8bf4\\uff0c\\u5979\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u8981\\u7a0d\\u5fae\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u9898\\u76ee\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u5979\\u4f1a\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Nathan has made excellent progress this week in class, mastering the alignment and addition/subtraction of decimal numbers with different place values. He answered 12 out of 13 in-class questions correctly and remained fully engaged and attentive throughout the lesson. The only question he missed was question #1, which he left unanswered. I encourage Nathan to review this question to build full confidence.  \\n\\nNathan missed 2 minutes of class due to brief disconnections, possibly related to the break. To help him maintain continuous attendance, please ensure his connection is stable and consider reaching out to Think customer service for technical support if needed. He kept his camera on the entire time, which positively supports his focus and participation.  \\n\\nOn homework, Nathan scored 92% on the recent assignment involving line graphs and trend lines. I recommend he watch the homework solution video to identify and correct any mistakes, which will deepen his understanding.  \\n\\nFor extra practice, Nathan can use additional supplemental problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide more problems upon request. We also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if he cannot attend live.  \\n\\nIf Nathan would benefit from targeted support, please consider booking up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Nathan\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5z0w.  \\n\\nThank you for your ongoing support.

I wanted to share some positive observations from this week's lessons on decimal alignment and operations.\\n\\nAlena demonstrated strong engagement and focus throughout our lessons on adding and subtracting decimals with different place values. She answered 12 in-class questions, with 7 correct answers\\u2014showing solid understanding of the core concepts. I did notice that she had some difficulty with questions #1, #5, #8, and #9, where her answers were partially correct. Additionally, she didn't attempt question #11. These moments tell me that Alena may benefit from extra practice with certain decimal alignment scenarios.\\n\\nI'm also pleased to note that Alena scored 100% on her previous homework assignment! That's excellent work and shows she's applying these skills well.\\n\\nThis week's homework focuses on plotting and interpreting line graphs, finding trend lines, and determining when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I encourage Alena to watch the homework solution video and use it to review her work and correct any mistakes. This will deepen her understanding before our next lesson.\\n\\nTo support Alena's continued growth, I'd like to suggest a few resources:\\n- Extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook for additional practice\\n- I offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app if she needs homework or workbook help\\n- If Alena would benefit from personalized one-on-one support, she has access to up to 3 free tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96x0bb\\n\\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Jing\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u5bf9Alena\\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u672c\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u548c\\u8fd0\\u7b97\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u89c2\\u5bdf\\u3002\\n\\nAlena\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5f3a\\u70c8\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u548c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u529b\\u3002\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d7\\u9053\\u7b54\\u6848\\u6b63\\u786e\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u6838\\u5fc3\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u6709\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c1\\u30015\\u30018\\u548c9\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u7b54\\u6848\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u8868\\u660eAlena\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u5728\\u67d0\\u4e9b\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u573a\\u666f\\u4e0a\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u8fd8\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u5730\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230Alena\\u5728\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4e86100%\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u51fa\\u8272\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u80fd\\u591f\\u5f88\\u597d\\u5730\\u5e94\\u7528\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u662f\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u627e\\u5230\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u786e\\u5b9a\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeAlena\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u65b9\\u6848\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7528\\u5b83\\u6765\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5979\\u7684\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u5e76\\u6539\\u6b63\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u4e0b\\u4e00\\u5802\\u8bfe\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u5979\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301Alena\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u51e0\\u4e2a\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff1a\\n- \\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4f9b\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\n- \\u6211\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u65b9\\u9762\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\n- \\u5982\\u679cAlena\\u53d7\\u76ca\\u4e8e\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96x0bb\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u7591\\u95ee\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Sitara has been very engaged and attentive during this week\\u2019s lessons on decimal addition and subtraction, especially when working through the fun math puzzles. She consistently kept her camera on, which really helped me connect with her and gauge her understanding throughout class.\\n\\nSitara answered 13 in-class questions, with 9 correct, 2 partially correct (questions #5 and #10), 1 incorrect (#12), and 1 unanswered (#11). This shows strong progress, though I encourage her to revisit questions 11 and 12 to solidify her understanding. \\n\\nHer last homework on line graphs was completed with a perfect score of 100%. Please encourage Sitara to watch the homework solution video to review any concepts she found tricky and ensure she continues to build confidence.\\n\\nFor further practice, she might find the extra supplemental problems in the workbook helpful, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great opportunity for Sitara to ask questions or get help with homework or workbook exercises. If she would benefit from more personalized support, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available this semester; you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Sitara\\u2019s performance in this week\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vXMgLr.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Iris has had a strong week in math, showing excellent focus and engagement during our lessons. This week, we worked on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, and Iris answered 12 out of 13 in-class questions correctly, with only one partially correct response on question #10. She remained attentive throughout class and kept her camera on consistently, which greatly helps her learning experience.\\n\\nI noticed Iris left the class one minute early. I understand that sometimes unexpected things come up, but if possible, please encourage her to stay through the entire session as this ensures she doesn\\u2019t miss any important closing activities or questions.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Iris scored 92% on her recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs and drawing trend lines. Watching the homework solution video and reviewing any errors could help her improve even further. If Iris would like extra practice, she can use the supplemental workbook problems or reach out for additional problems.\\n\\nPlease remind Iris that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, providing a great opportunity for extra help. Additionally, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Iris\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/R5QWzY.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Evelyn,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Sophia\\u2019s progress in our recent math class. This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, especially when their place values don\\u2019t line up, and also enjoyed some fun math puzzles involving these skills.\\n\\nSophia answered 11 in-class questions, correctly solving 8 of them. She did not answer questions #1, #10, and #11, which may be related to her arriving late and leaving early, as she missed 18 minutes of class time. I understand that sometimes unexpected things come up, but I encourage helping Sophia attend the full class to maximize her learning and participation. Additionally, there were two disconnections during class; please ensure her device connection is stable, and feel free to contact Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nSophia was engaged and attentive throughout, keeping her camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see. However, she did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. I encourage her to complete this homework soon to reinforce her understanding and keep pace with the class.\\n\\nFor additional practice, Sophia can work on extra problems in the supplemental workbook, or I can provide more problems upon request. Also, I hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where Sophia can get help with homework or workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if she cannot attend live sessions.\\n\\nIf you feel Sophia could benefit from more personalized guidance, please consider using the up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Zoe\\u2019s progress this week. She has been engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which greatly supports her focus. In class, Zoe answered 11 questions, getting 9 correct and thoughtfully working through the material. She did not answer questions #10 and #11, which suggests a small area where she might benefit from some extra practice or review.\\n\\nThis week\\u2019s topic involved aligning and adding or subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, combined with some fun math puzzles. Zoe showed strong understanding overall, and I encourage her to revisit those last two questions, perhaps with supplemental problems from the workbook or additional practice if you request it.\\n\\nHer homework on interpreting and plotting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and predicting values, earned an excellent score of 99%. I recommend having Zoe watch the homework solution video to catch any minor mistakes and reinforce her understanding.\\n\\nPlease remember that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook questions. Additionally, Zoe can access recordings of classes and office hours if she misses any live sessions. If you would like to explore more personalized support, Zoe can book up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed insights into Zoe\\u2019s in-class performance, you can view the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JEyzEo.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support in Zoe\\u2019s learning journey.

I noticed that Isaac was absent from class this week when we covered aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, as well as solving some fun math puzzles with decimals. I understand that with Thanksgiving approaching, there may have been holiday events or travel plans that came up unexpectedly. If you need assistance with rescheduling or transferring class times to better fit your schedule, please don\\u2019t hesitate to let me know\\u2014we are happy to support you and Isaac in staying on track.\\n\\nIsaac\\u2019s previous homework on line graphs earned a strong score of 92%, which is great to see. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review and correct any small mistakes he may have made; this can help deepen his understanding and prepare him for future assignments.\\n\\nTo help Isaac catch up on what he missed in class, we have extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I can provide additional practice upon request. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a good opportunity for him to get homework or workbook help. If a more personalized approach would be helpful, remember that Isaac can use up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester. You can book sessions anytime using this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

She has been very engaged and attentive throughout our lessons, consistently keeping her camera on, which helps her stay connected. This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with different place values, along with solving some enjoyable math puzzles involving decimal operations.\\n\\nCatherine answered 13 in-class questions, getting 10 correct, 1 incorrect (question #12), and leaving 2 unanswered (questions #8 and #11). These few missed and skipped questions indicate areas where she could benefit from a bit more practice and review to build confidence. Her previous homework on line graphs scored 85%, which is solid. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to help identify and correct any mistakes for deeper understanding.\\n\\nTo support Catherine\\u2019s continued growth, she can work on extra supplemental problems available in the workbook or request additional practice problems if needed. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are also a great opportunity for her to ask questions or get help with homework and workbook exercises.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,  \\n\\nI am pleased to share that Angela had a strong week in class. She answered 13 in-class questions, getting 12 fully correct and 1 partially correct (question #13), showing a solid grasp of the material. Angela was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and she kept her camera on consistently, which helps maintain connection and focus.  \\n\\nThis week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when the digits are not in the same place values, and also enjoyed solving math puzzles involving decimal operations. Angela demonstrated confidence in most tasks with no incorrect answers, which is excellent progress.  \\n\\nRegarding homework, Angela scored 92% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and choosing between line and bar graphs. To help her improve even further, I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes she made.  \\n\\nFor additional practice, Angela can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook, or I am happy to provide more problems upon request. She is also welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook support. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if she cannot attend live. Additionally, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nPlease feel free to review the detailed in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JbWMnq.

He remained engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, consistently keeping his camera on, which is wonderful to see. This week, we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits are in different place values, and Eason worked on some fun math puzzles using these skills.  \\n\\nEason answered 11 in-class questions: he got 6 correct, 1 partially correct (question #4), 1 incorrect (question #10), and left 3 unanswered (questions #1, #8, and #11). These particular questions might benefit from some extra review to build his confidence and accuracy.  \\n\\nHowever, I noticed Eason did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. Completing homework is important for reinforcing what we cover in class, so I encourage him to finish it soon and aim to complete future assignments on time.  \\n\\nTo support Eason, he can try extra problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. Also, please remind him that office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework or workbook questions. If you feel he would benefit from more personalized support, we also offer up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nFor more detailed information on Eason\\u2019s performance, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JeZ5OQ.  \\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Jayden\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bEason\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u90fd\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4ee4\\u4eba\\u6b23\\u6170\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\uff0cEason\\u8fd8\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002  \\n\\nEason\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff1a\\u5176\\u4e2d6\\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u7b2c4\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c1\\u4e2a\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u67093\\u4e2a\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u30018\\u548c11\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u590d\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u548c\\u51c6\\u786e\\u5ea6\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230Eason\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u91cd\\u8981\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u5c3d\\u5feb\\u5b8c\\u6210\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e89\\u53d6\\u4eca\\u540e\\u6309\\u65f6\\u63d0\\u4ea4\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301Eason\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u505a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u53e6\\u5916\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u4ed6\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97\\u4ed6\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u4e2a\\u522b\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8fd8\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8eEason\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JeZ5OQ\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

She demonstrated strong engagement and attentiveness during our lesson on adding and subtracting decimal numbers with different place values. Nicole answered 11 out of 13 questions correctly and had one partially correct response on question #11. She did not answer question #13, but she did not have any incorrect answers, which is a positive sign of her understanding overall. Nicole kept her camera consistently on, which helped maintain her focus throughout the lesson.\\n\\nHowever, Nicole did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I encourage Nicole to complete this homework as soon as possible to keep pace with the class and reinforce these important skills. Please remind her to submit homework on time in the future, as this will greatly support her learning.\\n\\nTo support Nicole\\u2019s continued growth, she is welcome to work on extra supplemental problems available in our workbook or request additional practice problems. We also offer office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework or workbook questions.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Jamie\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when the digits don\\u2019t share the same place value, along with some engaging math puzzles involving decimal operations. Jamie participated with good engagement and kept his camera on throughout, which was wonderful to see.\\n\\nJamie answered 13 questions in class, getting 7 fully correct and 1 partially correct (question #11). He did not answer questions #1, #7, #8, #9, and #13. It would be helpful to encourage Jamie to attempt all questions next time to build confidence and mastery in these areas. Additionally, Jamie missed 11 minutes of class due to a disconnection, which may have affected his ability to complete some questions. Please ensure a stable connection during class, and feel free to reach out to Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nRegarding homework on line graphs and trend lines, Jamie scored 85%. I recommend he watches the homework solution video to review any mistakes and strengthen his understanding. If Jamie would like extra practice, there are supplemental workbook problems available, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Jamie that office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app if he needs help with homework or workbook questions. Also, he can access recordings of classes and office hours if he cannot attend live. For more personalized support, Jamie can book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester using this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can view Jamie\\u2019s detailed in-class performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v0lE04.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Agnes\\u2019s progress this week. She participated actively in class as we focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, as well as solving fun math puzzles involving decimal operations. Agnes answered 11 questions in class, getting 10 correct and only one incorrect (question #10). She was engaged and attentive throughout, keeping her camera on consistently, which really helps her stay connected to the lesson.\\n\\nAgnes missed 4 minutes of the 90-minute class due to one disconnection, possibly related to the break. To support her continuous learning, please ensure her connection is stable, and feel free to reach out to Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nHer recent homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs earned a perfect score of 100%. I encourage Agnes to watch the homework solution video to reinforce her understanding and correct any small mistakes.\\n\\nIf Agnes would like extra practice, there are supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional exercises upon request. Also, please remind her about the Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, which are great for extra help with homework or workbook questions. If you feel Agnes could benefit from more personalized support, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available this semester; you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can review Agnes\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RqYj43.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support in Agnes\\u2019s learning journey. Please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bAgnes\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u662f\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u6570\\u7684\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u540c\\u65f6\\u8fd8\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6d89\\u53ca\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002Agnes\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u8bfe\\u5802\\uff0c\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8611\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d10\\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\u7b54\\u9519\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u8ddf\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u3002\\n\\nAgnes\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e864\\u5206\\u949f\\u768490\\u5206\\u949f\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u539f\\u56e0\\u662f\\u4e00\\u5904\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u4e0e\\u4f11\\u606f\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u6709\\u5173\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u5979\\u7684\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u8fde\\u63a5\\u7a33\\u5b9a\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u662f\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4e3a\\u6ee1\\u5206100%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeAgnes\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u5c0f\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cAgnes\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u4e50\\u610f\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u540c\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u7684Think\\u5b66\\u751f\\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u975e\\u5e38\\u9002\\u5408\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Agnes\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u67093\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bAgnes\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RqYj43\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u5bf9Agnes\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u7591\\u8651\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

I want to share some insights about Umair\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. He was engaged and attentive throughout our lesson on adding and subtracting decimal numbers with differing place values, and I appreciated that his camera was consistently on. Umair answered 13 questions in class, getting 6 fully correct and 5 partially correct, with 2 incorrect answers on questions #8 and #9. These particular questions indicate some concepts that could benefit from extra review.\\n\\nAdditionally, Umair did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on line graphs and trend lines. Completing this assignment will greatly help him build a stronger foundation for interpreting data visually, so I encourage him to finish it soon and submit future homework on time.\\n\\nTo support Umair\\u2019s learning, he can work on extra problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice if needed.

Bryan has shown great attentiveness and engagement in class this week while learning how to align and add/subtract decimal numbers with differing place values. He answered 12 out of 13 in-class questions correctly, with only question #3 posing a challenge. This is a strong performance, and I appreciate how consistently he keeps his camera on and stays focused during lessons.\\n\\nFor homework, Bryan scored 96% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to reinforce his understanding and correct any minor mistakes.\\n\\nTo further support Bryan\\u2019s progress, he might benefit from additional practice with the extra supplemental problems in the workbook. Please remind him that I\\u2019m also available during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook questions. If you feel Bryan would enjoy more personalized assistance, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available this semester.

Encouraging him to watch the homework solution video could help reinforce his strong grasp and catch any subtle mistakes.\\n\\nIf Daniel wants to deepen his skills, he can try extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems. Also, remember that I hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for extra help, and recordings are available if he can\\u2019t attend live. Should you feel he would benefit from personalized support, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available; you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to review Daniel\\u2019s detailed in-class performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1NpQ5.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Vina,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share some insights on Ethan\\u2019s progress in class this week. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers, especially when the digits don't line up in the same place values. Ethan was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson and kept his camera on consistently, which is great to see.\\n\\nRegarding his in-class work, Ethan answered 13 questions: he got 7 correct, 3 partially correct, 1 incorrect, and left 2 unanswered. Specifically, he struggled most with questions #1, #2, #8, #10, #11, and #12. Encouraging him to review those questions could be very helpful. His homework on plotting and interpreting line graphs scored 92%, which is excellent. I recommend that Ethan watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and reinforce his understanding.\\n\\nIf you feel Ethan would benefit from extra practice, he can work on supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request. We also hold office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook support. For more personalized help, Ethan can book up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in Ethan\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yomp0.

Looking forward to seeing you there!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jessica,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share some insights on Vincent\\u2019s progress this week in our math class. We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when digits fall into different place values, along with solving some engaging math puzzles using decimal operations.\\n\\nVincent was attentive and engaged throughout the lessons, and he consistently kept his camera on, which helped maintain great focus. However, I noticed that Vincent did not answer eight of the nine in-class questions, specifically questions #1 through #8, and only answered one correctly. This suggests he may need more practice and confidence with the material we covered.\\n\\nFor homework, Vincent scored 85% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. To help him improve further, I recommend that he watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes he made.\\n\\nTo support Vincent\\u2019s learning, please encourage him to try some extra problems from our supplemental workbook, which can reinforce the concepts. Additionally, he is welcome to attend our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for extra help with homework and workbook questions. If you feel Vincent could benefit from more personalized attention, we offer up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor a more detailed view of Vincent\\u2019s class performance, you can review the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96x0d6.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like additional resources.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Jessica\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bVincent\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u5bf9\\u9f50\\u5e76\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5c0f\\u6570\\u7684\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u8fd0\\u7b97\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u5728\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u4f4d\\u503c\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b57\\u76f8\\u52a0\\u51cf\\u65f6\\u7684\\u5904\\u7406\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u540c\\u65f6\\u4e5f\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u6709\\u8da3\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8c1c\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\nVincent\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u4e14\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u3002\\u7136\\u800c\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u4e5d\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u6709\\u516b\\u4e2a\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u81f3\\u7b2c8\\u9898\\uff09\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff0c\\u4ec5\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u548c\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u5bf9\\u6240\\u5b66\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cVincent\\u5728\\u6709\\u5173\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u4e8685\\u5206\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u63d0\\u9ad8\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u6790\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301Vincent\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u591a\\u505a\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Vincent\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bVincent\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96x0d6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

We focused on aligning and adding/subtracting decimal numbers when the digits are not in the same place values, along with solving some engaging math puzzles using those skills.  \\n\\nCami participated actively and kept her camera on throughout the class, demonstrating good engagement and attentiveness. She answered 10 questions in class, getting 8 correct. She struggled with question #5, which was answered incorrectly, and did not respond to question #1. These are areas we can revisit to build her confidence and accuracy.  \\n\\nCami missed about 10 minutes of class time and experienced 5 disconnections during the session, one possibly related to the break. To help her benefit fully from the lessons, please ensure her attendance is continuous and consider troubleshooting any technical issues. If needed, Think customer service is available to assist.  \\n\\nRegarding homework, Cami scored 73% on the recent assignment about plotting and interpreting line graphs and using trend lines for predictions. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes to strengthen her understanding.  \\n\\nTo support her further, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request.

Feedback is below.\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Huinan,  \\n\\nJane has been showing great engagement and focus in our Grade 4 Honors math class this week, with her camera consistently on and attentive participation. We studied how to align and add/subtract decimal numbers with different place values, and Jane answered 12 in-class questions, getting 9 fully correct, 1 partially correct (question #4), 1 incorrect (question #2), and 1 unanswered (question #12). This shows she is grasping the majority of the concepts well, though I recommend revisiting questions #2 and #4 with her to clarify any lingering confusion.  \\n\\nJane especially enjoyed the math puzzles involving decimal addition and subtraction, which helped reinforce her understanding in a fun way. To support her continued growth, I encourage her to try some extra supplemental problems in our workbook, which focus on similar decimal operations. If you would like, I can also provide additional practice problems tailored to her needs.  \\n\\nPlease remind Jane that it's important to attempt every question during class to maximize learning, aiming to answer the questions she left blank (#12).
