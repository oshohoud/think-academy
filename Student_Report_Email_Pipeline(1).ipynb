    "- Additional problems available upon request\n",
    "- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on Think Student app (homework and workbook help). Not taught by me, but no need to mention that.\n",

    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. Address the parent by name (use \"Parent\" if no name provided). If there is an extra section, address and greet the parent (I hope this email finds you well) BEFORE the extra section.\n",
    "2. Use the student's correct pronouns throughout\n",
    "3. Mention the specific in-class question numbers that the student struggled with (available in report).\n",
    "4. Do not mention the specific areas that the in-class questions covered, beyond the general subject matter covered in the lesson. That information is not available to you.\n",
    "5. There is no need to mention detailed attendance data (e.g. how many minutes the student did or did not attend) if the student attended the entire lesson or was entirely absent.\n",
    "6. If the student was partially absent, describe attendance data in minutes, not percentages. Since the full class time is 90 minutes, you would say to the parent of a child who missed 10% of the class that the child \"missed 9 minutes of class\". Round to the nearest minute.\n",
    "7. Unless otherwise specified in the above instructions, mention and comment on the student's homework score (as a percentage). If the student did not complete the homework, say they did not complete it and encourage them to complete it. Do not provide feedback about specific questions on the homework, since that information is not available to you\n",
    "8. Provide actionable recommendations based on the data\n",
    "9. If student was absent, focus on homework feedback and offer catch-up resources\n",
    "10. If provided above, include the in-class report link at the end of the email and mention to the parent they can find more detailed performance information in it.\n",
    "11. Be encouraging but honest about areas needing improvement\n",
    "12. Include relevant resources based on student's needs. If recommending 1-on-1 tutoring, include the tutoring link in the email.\n",
    "13. Keep tone warm, professional, and personalized\n",
    "14. Keep the feedback part (not including extra section) between 200-300 words. If the extra section is present, it should be written ABOVE/BEFORE the main email body and is not included in the word count. If an extra section was not mentioned, ignore this instruction.\n",
    "15. Do NOT use generic template language\n",
    "16. Do NOT include a subject at the top of the email body\n",
    "17. Do NOT use asterisks ** to indicate bold, this is for markdown and does not work for plain text.\n",
    "18. After the English email, write the exact same email translated into Mandarin Chinese.\n",
    "19. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PART OF THE INSTRUCTIONS OR PROMPT IN THE EMAIL!!!!!\n",

I'm writing to share an update on Thea's progress in math this week.\\n\\nThea has been doing solid work in class on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. She was engaged and attentive throughout our lessons, and her camera was consistently on, which I really appreciate. On our in-class questions, she answered 9 total, getting 6 correct. She did struggle with question #8 and didn't provide answers for questions #4 and #6, so those are areas where she might benefit from some additional practice.\\n\\nOn the homework side, Thea scored 91% on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes—a strong performance! I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution videos and take time to correct any mistakes. This will help her solidify her understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Thea's continued growth, I'd recommend exploring some of these resources: the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, the extra practice problems tailored to each lesson in the Learning Materials module of the Think Student app, or additional problems I can provide upon request. She's also welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. If she'd benefit from more personalized support, Thea qualifies for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98Prp1\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to support Thea's learning.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n亲爱的Kelsie，\\n\\n我希望这封邮件能够找到你并一切安好。我写这封邮件是想和你分享Thea在数学课上这周的进展。\\n\\nThea在学习分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数和约分化简方面表现稳定。她在整个课堂上都表现得专注和认真，摄像头也一直开着，我对此非常感谢。在我们的课堂提问中，她共回答了9个问题，其中6个正确。她在第8题上遇到了困难，第4题和第6题没有提供答案，所以这些是她可能需要进行额外练习的领域。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Thea在求长方体和立方体体积的作业中得分91%——这是一个很强的表现！我建议她观看家庭作业解答视频，花时间改正任何错误。这将帮助她在我们继续前进之前巩固她的理解。\\n\\n为了支持Thea的持续进步，我建议她探索以下一些资源：练习册中的额外补充问题、Think Student应用中学习材料模块中针对每节课的额外练习问题，或者我可以提供的额外问题。她也欢迎参加每周二太平洋标准时间下午5点在Think Student应用上的办公时间，以获得家庭作业和练习册帮助。如果Thea需要更个性化的支持，她有资格在每个学期获得最多3次免费的一对一辅导课程，你可以在这里预订：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n你可以在课堂内报告中找到更详细的表现信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98Prp1\\n\\n如果你有任何问题，或者有什么我可以做的来支持Thea的学习，请随时告诉我。\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

She was engaged and attentive throughout, keeping her camera consistently on, which helped foster a positive learning environment.\\n\\nOn homework covering the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using formulas like length x width x height or base area x height, Katherine scored 88% on her previous assignment—a solid effort that shows good understanding, though there’s room to strengthen accuracy. I encourage you to have her watch the provided homework solution videos to review and correct her mistakes; this targeted review will help solidify her skills.\\n\\nTo build on her momentum, Katherine could benefit from extra practice: try the supplemental problems in the workbook, or the lesson-specific extra practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app. Additional problems are available upon request, and office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app offer great support for homework and workbook questions.

I noticed she was attentive and kept her camera on consistently, which shows her commitment to learning.\\n\\nIn class, Isabel answered 12 questions, getting 7 correct. She did encounter some difficulty with questions #9 and #12, and there were three questions (#7, #10, and #11) where she didn't provide an answer. This is completely normal as she's working with new concepts—these moments are valuable learning opportunities.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Isabel scored 88% on her assignment about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. This is a strong score that reflects her understanding of the material. I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution videos and take time to review the questions she missed. This practice will help solidify her skills.\\n\\nTo support Isabel's continued growth, I'd like to recommend a few resources:\\n\\n• Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson are available in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module within the Think Student app\\n• Supplemental problems in the workbook offer additional reinforcement\\n• My office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help\\n• If Isabel would benefit from more personalized support, she's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions. You can also find more detailed performance information in Isabel's in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xrbw\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n尊敬的 Ling，\\n\\n我希望这封邮件能找到您安好。\\n\\n这周，Isabel 在数学课上取得了稳定的进步。在我们关于分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数和交叉化简的课程中，她表现出了强烈的参与度。我注意到她专注且认真，并且始终保持摄像头打开，这表明了她对学习的投入。\\n\\n在课堂上，Isabel 回答了 12 道题目，其中 7 道答对。她在第 9 题和第 12 题上遇到了一些困难，还有三道题目（第 7、10 和 11 题）她没有给出答案。这完全是正常的，因为她正在学习新概念——这些时刻是宝贵的学习机会。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Isabel 在关于计算长方体和立方体体积的作业中获得了 88% 的成绩。这是一个很好的成绩，反映了她对这些材料的理解。我建议她观看家庭作业解决方案视频，并花时间复习她做错的题目。这样的练习将帮助她巩固技能。\\n\\n为了支持 Isabel 的持续进步，我想推荐几个资源：\\n\\n• 针对每堂课的额外练习题可在 Think Student 应用程序的\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中找到\\n• 工作簿中的补充题目提供额外的强化练习\\n• 我的办公时间是每周二太平洋时间下午 5 点，在 Think Student 应用程序上进行家庭作业和工作簿帮助\\n• 如果 Isabel 需要更个性化的支持，她每学期可获得最多 3 次免费的一对一辅导课程：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n如有任何问题，请随时与我联系。您也可以在 Isabel 的课堂报告中找到更详细的成绩信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xrbw\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼\\nOmar 老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

This week in class, Maxwell and his classmates worked on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. He was engaged and attentive throughout, keeping his camera on consistently, which really helps him stay connected with the group.\\n\\nMaxwell answered 12 in-class questions, getting 8 correct—a solid effort! He missed Question #1, likely because he arrived a couple of minutes late (he attended 88 out of 90 minutes). I know things come up sometimes, but encouraging him to arrive on time will help him catch everything from the start. There was also one disconnection, possibly during the break; ensuring a stable connection moving forward would be great. If technical issues persist, feel free to reach out to Think customer service for support. He struggled with Questions #6, #9, and #11, so reviewing those specific ones in the class report could pinpoint areas for practice.\\n\\nOn homework about **finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes** (using length x width x height or base area x height), Maxwell scored 77% previously. Please have him watch the solution videos to correct his mistakes—this is a fantastic way to build understanding.\\n\\nTo support his progress, I recommend extra supplemental problems in the workbook, practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, or additional ones upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the app for homework and workbook help. Class and office hour recordings are available too. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can make a big difference: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details, check the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JwogmA.

They were engaged and attentive throughout, and kept their camera consistently on, which helped create a positive learning environment.\\n\\nRui's previous homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or area of base x height earned an excellent 96% score—great job maintaining high standards! To build on this success and ensure mastery, I encourage you to have Rui watch the homework solution videos and correct any mistakes.\\n\\nFor continued progress, especially on those in-class questions, Rui can benefit from extra practice. I recommend the supplemental problems in the workbook, extra practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module for each lesson in the Think Student app, or additional problems available upon request. Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are perfect for homework and workbook help, with recordings available if live attendance isn't possible.

She demonstrated strong understanding of this week's lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. During our in-class activities, Joyce answered 11 out of 12 questions correctly, showing solid mastery of the material. She only struggled with question #11, which we can address with some targeted practice.\\n\\nJoyce's engagement in class has been wonderful—she's been attentive and actively participating. I did notice one brief technical disconnection during class this week, so I'd encourage you to help ensure her connection stays stable throughout our lessons. Also, while her camera was mostly on, consistently having it on helps me better support her learning.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Joyce scored 81% on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. This is a good foundation, but there's room for improvement. I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution videos and work through her mistakes—this is one of the most effective ways to strengthen her skills before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Joyce's continued growth, here are some resources I'd recommend:\\n- Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app\\n- Supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice\\n- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT if she needs homework or workbook help\\n- If she'd benefit from more personalized support, she's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nJoyce is on a great trajectory. With a bit more focus on homework accuracy and consistent engagement, she'll continue to excel.

Samuel demonstrated strong engagement throughout the lesson—he was attentive and kept his camera on consistently, which helped him stay connected with the class.\\n\\nOut of 12 in-class questions, he answered 9 correctly, which is a solid performance. He had one incorrect answer on Question #9 and left Questions #10 and #11 unanswered. These are great opportunities for him to build confidence in tackling every problem. His previous homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height scored an impressive 92%. To strengthen his understanding, I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution videos and correct his mistakes—this targeted review will reinforce key concepts.\\n\\nTo support his growth, Samuel could benefit from extra practice on fraction multiplication.

This week in class, we focused on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. Travis showed great engagement—he was attentive throughout and kept his camera on consistently, which really helps him stay connected with the lesson.\\n\\nHe answered 12 in-class questions, getting 6 correct, which is a solid effort on these new concepts. However, he struggled with questions #3, #4, and #11 (incorrect), and didn't answer #1, #8, and #10. Travis arrived a few minutes late, missing about 3 minutes at the start, which likely explains the unanswered early questions like #1—things come up sometimes, but helping him arrive on time will ensure he catches everything from the beginning. He also had one disconnection, possibly during the break; please encourage continuous attendance and check for any technical issues. If needed, reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Travis did not complete last week's assignment on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes (using length x width x height or base area x height). I'd encourage him to finish it soon and prioritize completing future assignments on time to build momentum.\\n\\nTo support his progress, especially on those trickier questions, I recommend extra supplemental problems in the workbook, practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, or additional ones upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the app for homework and workbook help. Class and office hour recordings are available too. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can provide personalized boost: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details, check the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/R2WrbY.

I wanted to share some observations about her progress and offer some guidance for continued growth.\\n\\nDuring our live class sessions, Zoe has been engaged and attentive, which I truly appreciate. She answered 12 in-class questions this week, getting 7 correct and 1 partially correct. However, she did struggle with questions #7 and #9, and left questions #11 and #12 unanswered. These areas represent opportunities for her to deepen her understanding of the concepts we're covering.\\n\\nOn the homework side, Zoe scored 85% on her assignment about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. This is a solid effort, and I'd like to encourage her to watch the solution videos for any problems she missed and correct those mistakes. This practice will help reinforce the formulas and build her confidence with this material.\\n\\nTo support Zoe's continued progress, I'd recommend a few resources. She can access extra practice problems tailored to each lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, or work through supplemental problems in the workbook. If she'd like more personalized support, she's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester—you can book one here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Additionally, office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT if she needs extra help with homework or workbook problems.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JZg3a2.\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Zoe's learning. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的家长，\\n\\n祝您安好。\\n\\n本周在数学课上，Zoe 一直在学习用整数乘以分数、用分数乘以分数以及交叉化简。我想与您分享她的进度观察，并为她的持续进步提供一些指导。\\n\\n在我们的直播课程中，Zoe 表现出了专注和认真的态度，我对此表示真诚的感谢。本周她回答了 12 道课堂问题，其中 7 道正确，1 道部分正确。但是，她在第 7 和第 9 题上遇到了困难，第 11 和第 12 题没有作答。这些领域代表了她深化对我们所学概念理解的机会。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Zoe 在关于求长方体和立方体体积的作业中得分为 85%。这是一个不错的成绩，我想鼓励她观看她做错的任何问题的解答视频，并改正这些错误。这样的练习将帮助她加强对公式的理解，并增强她在这方面的信心。\\n\\n为了支持 Zoe 的持续进步，我建议使用以下几个资源。她可以在 Think Student 应用程序的\\\"学习资料\\\"模块中获取针对每节课的额外练习题，或在补充教材中做练习题。如果她需要更个性化的支持，她每学期有资格获得 3 次免费的一对一辅导课程——您可以在这里预订：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。此外，每周二太平洋时间下午 5 点提供办公时间，如果她需要家庭作业或教材方面的额外帮助，可以参加。\\n\\n您可以在她的课堂报告中找到更详细的成绩信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JZg3a2。\\n\\n感谢您在支持 Zoe 学习中的合作。如果您有任何问题，请随时与我联系。\\n\\n温暖的问候，\\nOmar 老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

She attended 67 minutes of the 90-minute class, arriving late and leaving early—sometimes things come up, and I understand there may have been good reasons. This likely explains the unanswered earlier and later questions. She also had 2 disconnections, one possibly during the break. To build on her strengths, I gently encourage you to help her arrive on time and stay until the end, and to troubleshoot any technical issues—Think customer service can assist if needed.\\n\\nOn homework about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height, she scored a perfect 100% previously—outstanding work!

She demonstrated strong engagement and focus during our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Jane answered 10 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, which shows solid understanding of these concepts. She did leave questions #7 and #8 unanswered, so these may be areas where she'd benefit from a bit more practice or clarification.\\n\\nJane's homework performance continues to be excellent—she earned a 95% on her most recent assignment on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. This is fantastic work and reflects her commitment to mastering the material.\\n\\nTo help Jane continue building on this success, I'd encourage her to review the homework solution videos and correct any mistakes from her assignments. This practice helps reinforce understanding and prevents small gaps from growing into larger ones.\\n\\nI also noticed Jane's camera is mostly on during class, which is great for engagement. I'd gently encourage her to keep it on consistently, as it helps me better support her learning.\\n\\nIf Jane would like additional practice, we have several resources available: supplemental problems in the workbook, extra practice problems tailored to each lesson in the Learning Materials module, or additional problems upon request. Jane is also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help. Additionally, she has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester if she'd like personalized support: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yoDp8\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in Jane's learning. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n亲爱的Huinan，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您时一切安好。\\n\\n我想与您分享关于Jane本周数学课程进展的好消息。她在我们关于分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉化简的课程中表现出了强烈的参与度和专注力。Jane在12道课堂提问中正确回答了10道，这表明她对这些概念有扎实的理解。她没有回答第7和第8题，所以这些可能是她需要更多练习或澄清的领域。\\n\\nJane的家庭作业成绩继续表现出色——她在最近关于求长方体和立方体体积的作业中获得了95%的成绩。这是非常棒的成果，反映了她掌握这些知识的承诺。\\n\\n为了帮助Jane继续取得进步，我建议她观看家庭作业解答视频，并纠正她作业中的任何错误。这种练习有助于加强理解，防止小的知识漏洞演变成更大的问题。\\n\\n我还注意到Jane在课堂上的摄像头大多处于打开状态，这对参与度很有帮助。我温和地建议她保持摄像头始终打开，因为这能帮助我更好地支持她的学习。\\n\\n如果Jane想要额外的练习，我们有几种资源可用：工作簿中的补充问题、在学习材料模块中为每节课量身定制的额外练习题，或根据需要提供的其他问题。Jane也可以参加每周二太平洋时间下午5点在Think Student应用上的办公时间，获得家庭作业和工作簿帮助。此外，她每学期可以获得3次免费的一对一辅导课程：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n您可以在此课堂报告中找到更详细的成绩信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yoDp8\\n\\n感谢您在Jane学习中的合作。如果您有任何问题，请随时与我联系。\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼，\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

I wanted to share a quick update on Anna's strong progress in our recent math class.\\n\\nAnna demonstrated excellent focus and engagement throughout the week’s lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. She remained attentive with her camera consistently on, answering 13 in-class questions with 11 correct. This is impressive work, reflecting her solid grasp of the material. She had one incorrect answer on Question #10 and left Question #11 unanswered, which are minor areas we can target for review. Overall, her performance shows she is building confidence in these foundational skills.\\n\\nOn homework covering the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using formulas like length x width x height or base area x height, Anna earned a perfect 100% score—outstanding! To reinforce her success and address those two in-class questions, I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution videos and correct any lingering mistakes from the lesson. This will help solidify her understanding.\\n\\nFor extra practice, she can tackle supplemental problems in the workbook, lesson-specific problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, or request additional ones from me. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the app for homework and workbook support, with recordings available if live attendance isn't possible. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are also offered here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details on her in-class performance, please check the report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/94xrWr.\\n\\nThank you for your support—Anna is thriving!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的 Jinying，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。我想分享一下安娜在我们最近数学课上的良好进步更新。\\n\\n安娜在本周关于整数乘分数、分数乘分数以及交叉简化等课程中表现出色，始终专注且投入。她保持摄像头开启，回答了13道课堂问题，其中11道正确。这是一项令人印象深刻的工作，反映了她对这些材料的扎实掌握。她在第10题上有一个错误答案，第11题未作答，这些是我们可以针对性复习的细小领域。总体而言，她的表现显示她在这些基础技能上正在建立信心。\\n\\n关于家庭作业，涵盖使用长×宽×高或底面积×高等公式求矩形棱柱和立方体的体积，安娜获得了完美的100%分数——太棒了！为了强化她的成功并解决那两道课堂问题，我鼓励您让她观看家庭作业解题视频并纠正课堂中的任何遗留错误。这将有助于巩固她的理解。\\n\\n为了额外练习，她可以在练习册中尝试补充问题、在Think Student app的“学习材料”模块中查看每节课的特定练习题，或向我请求更多问题。周二下午5点（太平洋夏令时）在app上有办公时间，提供家庭作业和练习册帮助，如果无法直播参加，也有录音可用。本学期还提供最多3次免费一对一辅导课程，请在此预订：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n有关她课堂表现的更多细节，请查看报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/94xrWr。\\n\\n感谢您的支持——安娜正在茁壮成长！\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼，\\nOmar 老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

This week in class, we focused on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. Hannah did an outstanding job, answering 12 out of 13 in-class questions correctly with no partially correct or incorrect responses. She only left Question #11 unanswered, which is a minor hiccup in an otherwise perfect performance. Throughout the lesson, she was engaged and attentive, and she kept her camera consistently on, which helped create a positive learning environment for everyone.\\n\\nOn the homework front, covering **finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes** using formulas like length x width x height or area of base x height, Hannah earned a perfect **100%** score, continuing her strong streak from previous assignments. That's fantastic progress—keep it up, Hannah!\\n\\nTo build on this momentum, I recommend reviewing the single unanswered question from class. The detailed in-class report is available here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vzolpn, where you can see more specifics on her performance. For homework mastery, please encourage Hannah to watch the solution videos and correct any mistakes she may have initially made. Extra practice is readily available: supplemental problems in the workbook, lesson-specific problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, or additional ones upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the app for homework and workbook support, and recordings of classes and office hours are accessible if live attendance isn't possible.

Overall, Clark has been engaged and attentive during our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. His camera has been consistently on, and he's been actively participating in our discussions.\\n\\nDuring this week's in-class practice, Clark answered 13 questions total, with 5 correct responses. However, he struggled with several questions—specifically #2, #3, #6, #9, #10, and #12—and didn't attempt to answer questions #8 and #11. This tells me that while Clark is engaged, he may need additional support to solidify his understanding of these concepts before moving forward.\\n\\nOn a more positive note, Clark completed last week's homework with a perfect 100% score, which shows he's capable of mastering the material with focused effort.\\n\\nFor this week's homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes, I encourage Clark to watch the solution videos and carefully review any mistakes. This reflective practice is invaluable for building confidence and understanding.\\n\\nTo support Clark's continued growth, I'd like to suggest a few resources:\\n\\n- Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson are available in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module in the Think Student app\\n- Supplemental problems are available in the workbook\\n- Office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for additional homework and workbook support\\n- If Clark would benefit from more personalized instruction, he has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RqY3gQ\\n\\nI'm confident that with some additional practice and review, Clark will strengthen his skills in these important concepts. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or if Clark needs further support.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n亲爱的Colin，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到你时一切安好。\\n\\n我想与您分享Clark本周数学课程的进展情况。总的来说，Clark在我们关于分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉约分的课程中表现得很投入和专注。他的摄像头始终保持打开状态，并且积极参与我们的讨论。\\n\\n在本周的课堂练习中，Clark总共回答了13道题目，其中5道正确。不过，他在几道题目上遇到了困难——特别是第#2、#3、#6、#9、#10和#12题——并且没有尝试回答第#8和#11题。这表明虽然Clark很投入，但他可能需要额外的支持来巩固对这些概念的理解，然后才能继续向前。\\n\\n更积极的一面是，Clark上周的家庭作业得分达到了完美的100%，这表明他有能力通过专注的努力来掌握这些材料。\\n\\n对于本周关于计算长方体和立方体体积的家庭作业，我建议Clark观看解答视频，并仔细复习任何错误之处。这种反思性的练习对于建立信心和理解至关重要。\\n\\n为了支持Clark的持续进步，我想建议几个资源：\\n\\n- 针对每节课的额外练习题可在Think Student应用的\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中找到\\n- 补充问题可在练习册中找到\\n- 办公时间每周二下午5点PDT在Think Student应用上举行，用于额外的家庭作业和练习册支持\\n- 如果Clark能从更个性化的教学中受益，他每学期可获得最多3次免费的一对一辅导课程：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n您可以在课堂报告中找到更详细的成绩信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RqY3gQ\\n\\n我相信通过一些额外的练习和复习，Clark将加强他在这些重要概念中的技能。如果您有任何问题或Clark需要进一步的支持，请随时与我联系。\\n\\n温暖的问候，\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

This week in class, we focused on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Jessica did an excellent job overall, answering 13 in-class questions with 10 correct. She remained engaged and attentive throughout, and kept her camera on consistently, which helped her stay connected with the group.\\n\\nThat said, she had a couple of bumps: she got questions #1 and #12 incorrect, and left #11 unanswered. These are great opportunities for review, as mastering these skills will solidify her understanding of fraction multiplication. For homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height, she scored an impressive 96% on the previous assignment—wonderful work maintaining that high level!\\n\\nTo build on her strengths and address those specific questions, I recommend Jessica watch the homework solution videos to correct any mistakes and reinforce concepts. Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson are available in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, and supplemental problems in the workbook can provide more hands-on review. Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are perfect for homework or workbook help, with recordings available if live attendance isn't possible. Additional problems are available upon request, and up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can offer personalized support: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ3nW. Jessica is making strong progress, and with a bit more targeted practice, she'll be even more confident. Please let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Liuying，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您时一切安好。\\n\\n希望您一切安好。本周课堂上，我们重点学习了分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉化简。Jessica整体表现优秀，回答了13道课堂问题，其中10道正确。她全程参与积极、注意力集中，并且始终保持摄像头开启，这有助于她与小组保持联系。\\n\\n不过，她遇到了一些小挑战：第1题和第12题答错了，第11题未作答。这些是很好的复习机会，掌握这些技能将巩固她对分数乘法的理解。家庭作业主题是使用长×宽×高或底面积×高来求长方体和立方体的体积，她在上次作业中取得了令人印象深刻的96%成绩——保持高水平，真是太棒了！\\n\\n为了发扬她的优势并针对那些具体问题，我建议Jessica观看家庭作业解题视频来纠正错误并强化概念。每节课量身定制的额外练习题可在Think Student应用的“学习材料”模块中找到，工作簿中的补充题也能提供更多动手练习。每周二下午5点（太平洋夏令时）在Think Student应用上有办公时间，适合家庭作业或工作簿帮助，如果无法直播参加，有录像可用。如需更多题目，请随时提出。本学期最多3次免费一对一辅导课可提供个性化支持：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n您可以在课堂报告中找到更详细的表现信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ3nW。Jessica进步很大，再加上一些针对性练习，她会更加自信。请随时告诉我如果您有任何问题。\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼，\\nTeacher Omar\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

He answered 13 in-class questions, getting 11 correct, with just one incorrect on Question #9 and one unanswered, Question #11. This shows he's grasping the concepts well overall, and his engagement was excellent—he stayed attentive throughout with his camera consistently on.\\n\\nHe did miss 6 minutes of our 90-minute class due to 2 disconnections (one possibly during the break). To help him stay fully connected, please ensure a stable internet setup and troubleshoot any issues. Think customer service is available if technical support is needed.\\n\\nOn homework about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height, Arthur scored a perfect 100% previously—fantastic job! To build on this, have him watch the homework solution videos and correct any mistakes for reinforcement.\\n\\nFor targeted practice on those in-class questions, I recommend the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, or the lesson-specific practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app. Additional problems are available upon request, and office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the app for homework and workbook help. Class and office hour recordings are accessible if he misses any live sessions. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can provide personalized support: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details on his in-class performance, check the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vAmrye.\\n\\nI'm proud of Arthur's progress and excited for what's ahead. Please reach out with any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Maggie，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您时一切安好。\\n\\nArthur在本周的数学课上表现优秀，我们重点学习了分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉化简。他回答了13道课堂问题，其中11道正确，只有一道Question #9错误，一道Question #11未答。这表明他整体上很好地掌握了这些概念，他的参与度很高——全程专注，摄像头一直开着。\\n\\n他在我们90分钟的课堂中缺席了6分钟，因为有2次断线（其中一次可能是在休息时）。为了帮助他保持全程连接，请确保网络稳定并排查任何问题。如果需要技术支持，Think客服随时可用。\\n\\n关于家庭作业——使用长度×宽度×高度或底面积×高度求矩形棱柱和立方体的体积，Arthur上次的成绩是完美的100%——做得太棒了！为了巩固，请让他观看家庭作业解题视频并纠正任何错误。\\n\\n针对那些课堂问题，我推荐工作簿中的额外补充练习，或者Think Student app“学习材料”模块中针对每节课的额外练习题。如需更多问题，请随时告知。周二下午5点（PDT）在app上有办公时间，提供家庭作业和工作簿帮助。如果错过直播课程，课堂和办公时间录像均可访问。每学期最多3次免费一对一辅导课可提供个性化支持：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n更多课堂表现详情，请查看此报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vAmrye。\\n\\n我为Arthur的进步感到骄傲，并期待他未来的表现。如有任何问题，请随时联系。\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nTeacher Omar\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

He answered 13 questions, getting 12 correct and leaving just Question #11 unanswered, which shows his strong grasp of the material overall. Peter was engaged and attentive throughout, with his camera consistently on, contributing positively to our class discussions.\\n\\nOn the homework covering finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or area of base x height, he scored 81% on the previous assignment—a solid effort, though there's room to strengthen his accuracy. I encourage you to have Peter watch the homework solution videos and correct his mistakes, as this will help solidify these concepts.\\n\\nTo build on his great in-class performance and boost homework results, Peter could benefit from extra practice. I recommend the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, or the tailored practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module for each lesson in the Think Student app. Additional problems are available upon request, and office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app offer great support for homework and workbook help. Recordings of classes and office hours are available too. For personalized guidance, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPeter is making wonderful progress, and with a bit more targeted practice at home, he'll excel even further.

To ensure he catches every key moment, please help him maintain a stable connection—troubleshooting technical issues or reaching out to Think customer service if needed would be great.\\n\\nOn homework, Andrew earned a perfect **100%** on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height—fantastic job maintaining his streak! If any minor errors popped up, encourage him to watch the solution videos and correct them for deeper understanding.\\n\\nTo build on his momentum, I recommend extra supplemental problems in the workbook, or lesson-specific practice in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app. Additional problems are available upon request, and office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help. Class and office hour recordings are accessible too. For personalized support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details on his in-class performance, check the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9Lnr81. Andrew's dedication is paying off—keep it up!\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Serena，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。\\n\\n希望您一切安好！本周课堂上，我们重点学习了**整数乘分数**、**分数乘分数**和**交叉简化**。Andrew表现出色——他全程专注，摄像头一直开着，并回答了13道课堂问题，其中11道正确。这显示了他对这些概念的出色掌握，真是了不起的努力！\\n\\n他在第7题答错了一道，第11题未作答，所以练习类似问题将有助于巩固这些技能。他还因1次断线错过了90分钟课堂中的仅1分钟（其中一次可能是在休息时）。为确保他不错过任何关键内容，请帮助他保持稳定连接——如有需要，排查技术问题或联系Think客服即可。\\n\\n家庭作业方面，Andrew在计算长方体和立方体体积（使用长×宽×高或底面积×高公式）中获得满分**100%**——保持完美记录，太棒了！如果有任何小错误，请鼓励他观看解答视频并改正，以加深理解。\\n\\n为进一步提升，我推荐工作簿中的额外补充题，或Think Student app“学习材料”模块中的课时特定练习题。如需更多，可随时请求。周二下午5点（PDT）有办公时间，提供作业和工作簿帮助。课堂和办公时间录像均可访问。如需个性化支持，本学期可免费预约最多3次一对一辅导：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n更多课堂表现详情，请查看报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9Lnr81。Andrew的努力正在见效——继续保持！\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nTeacher Omar\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

This week in class, Caleb demonstrated great engagement and attentiveness, keeping his camera on consistently throughout the session, which really helps him stay connected with the material and his classmates. We covered multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification, and I'm pleased to see his enthusiasm for these topics.\\n\\nCaleb answered 13 in-class questions, getting 6 correct, which shows he's grasping some key concepts solidly. However, he had 6 incorrect answers on questions #2, #4, #5, #9, #10, and #12, and left #11 unanswered. This suggests he may need a bit more practice to build confidence with the procedures, especially where errors cropped up repeatedly. It's common for students to need targeted review at this stage, and Caleb's attentive participation is a strong foundation for improvement—he's clearly putting in the effort.\\n\\nTo help him strengthen these skills, I recommend reviewing the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, as well as the extra practice problems tailored for each lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app. These are perfect for reinforcing multiplying fractions without overwhelming him. Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are great for workbook help, and recordings are available if you can't attend live. If he'd benefit from personalized guidance, we offer up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester—book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Additional problems are available upon request too.\\n\\nI'm confident that with a little extra focus, Caleb will master these skills quickly. For more detailed performance info, check the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg53G5.\\n\\nThank you, and please reach out with any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Christine，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您时一切安好。\\n\\n希望您一切安好。本周课堂上，Caleb表现出色地参与并保持专注，整个过程中摄像头一直开着，这真的帮助他与材料和同学们保持联系。我们学习了分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉简化，我很高兴看到他对这些主题的热情。\\n\\nCaleb回答了13道课堂问题，答对6道，这表明他已经牢固掌握了一些关键概念。然而，他在第2、4、5、9、10和12题上有6道错误答案，第11题未作答。这表明他可能需要多练习一些来建立信心，特别是那些反复出错的地方。在这个阶段，学生们常见需要针对性复习，而Caleb专注的参与是改进的坚实基础——他显然在努力。\\n\\n为了帮助他加强这些技能，我推荐复习练习册中的额外补充问题，以及Think Student app“学习材料”模块中为每节课量身定制的额外练习问题。这些非常适合强化分数乘法，而不会让他感到负担。周二下午5点（PDT）在Think Student app上的办公时间非常适合练习册帮助，如果无法直播参加，也有录音可用。如果他需要个性化指导，我们每学期提供最多3次免费一对一辅导课程——预约链接：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。如需更多问题，也可随时索取。\\n\\n我相信通过少许额外专注，Caleb很快就能掌握这些技能。更多详细表现信息，请查看课堂报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg53G5。\\n\\n谢谢，如有任何问题请随时联系。\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼，\\nTeacher Omar\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

I wanted to share some positive feedback about Christian's progress this week in math class.\\n\\nChristian has been engaged and attentive throughout our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. He consistently kept his camera on and participated actively in class discussions. Out of 11 in-class questions, he answered 7 correctly, which shows solid understanding of the core concepts.\\n\\nI did notice that Christian found questions #2, #6, and #9 challenging, and question #8 was partially correct. These areas represent opportunities for strengthening his skills, and I'd like to help him build confidence in these specific problem types.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Christian earned an excellent 99% on his previous assignment about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. This demonstrates his ability to apply formulas accurately, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nTo support Christian's continued growth, I recommend he watch the homework solution videos to review any mistakes and reinforce his understanding. Additionally, I'd suggest exploring the extra practice problems available in our \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module in the Think Student app, which are tailored to each lesson. The supplemental workbook also contains extra problems if he'd like additional practice.\\n\\nIf Christian would benefit from more personalized support, he has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nFeel free to reach out with any questions. You can also view a detailed breakdown of Christian's in-class performance here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXrap\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n亲爱的Susana，\\n\\n希望这封邮件能够找到您。我想和您分享关于Christian本周数学课程进展的一些积极反馈。\\n\\nChristian在我们关于分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数和约分的课程中表现得很专注和认真。他始终保持摄像头打开，并积极参与课堂讨论。在11道课堂问题中，他答对了7道，这表明他对核心概念有了扎实的理解。\\n\\n我注意到Christian在第2、6和9题中遇到了困难，第8题部分正确。这些领域代表了加强他技能的机会，我想帮助他在这些特定的问题类型中建立信心。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Christian在关于求矩形棱柱和立方体体积的上一次作业中获得了99%的优异成绩。这表明他能够准确应用公式，这非常好。\\n\\n为了支持Christian的持续进步，我建议他观看家庭作业解决方案视频，以复习任何错误并加强他的理解。此外，我建议他在Think Student应用程序的\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中探索针对每节课的额外练习题。补充工作簿中也有额外的问题，如果他想要更多练习。\\n\\n如果Christian需要更个性化的支持，他可以在每学期内获得最多3次免费的一对一辅导课程。您可以在此处预订课程：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n如有任何问题，请随时与我联系。您也可以在此处查看Christian的课堂表现的详细信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXrap\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

This week in class, we focused on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Isabella did an outstanding job overall, answering 11 in-class questions with 10 correct and just 1 incorrect on Question #6. She was engaged and attentive throughout, and kept her camera on consistently, which really helps her stay connected with the lesson.\\n\\nIsabella attended 88 minutes of our 90-minute class, arriving a couple of minutes late. I understand that sometimes things come up, so no worries this time—though starting on time ensures she catches every key explanation, especially for the early questions. She also had one disconnection, which might have coincided with the break, but please help her troubleshoot any technical issues for smoother participation. If needed, Think customer service can assist.\\n\\nFor homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height, Isabella scored a perfect 100%—fantastic work building on her previous perfect score! To reinforce her strong start, please have her watch the homework solution videos to review any subtle points.\\n\\nTo build on her success and target that one tricky question, I recommend extra supplemental problems in the workbook, practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module of the Think Student app, or additional ones upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT in the app for homework and workbook help, and class/office hour recordings are available too. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can provide personalized support: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details, check the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jl4LnA.

I wanted to share some wonderful news about Kingston's progress this week in math class.\\n\\nKingston had an excellent week in our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. During our in-class work, he answered 10 out of 11 questions correctly, demonstrating strong understanding of the material. He only left one question unanswered. Kingston was engaged and attentive throughout class, with his camera consistently on, which really helps him stay connected to the learning. I did notice he missed about 8 minutes of class this week due to a few brief disconnections—if technical issues persist, our Think customer service team can help troubleshoot.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Kingston earned a solid 92% on last week's assignment about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. That's great work! I encourage him to review the homework solution videos to understand any mistakes and strengthen his skills even further.\\n\\nTo continue building on this momentum, here are some resources that might help:\\n- Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson are available in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module in the Think Student app\\n- Supplemental problems are available in the workbook\\n- Additional problems can be provided upon request\\n- Office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT if Kingston needs extra support\\n- If he'd benefit from more personalized attention, Kingston qualifies for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98Prl1\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to support Kingston's learning.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Cindy，\\n\\n希望这封邮件能够找到你，一切安好。我想和你分享关于Kingston这周数学课程中的一些好消息。\\n\\nKingston这周在分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数和约分的课程中表现出色。在课堂练习中，他答对了11道题中的10道，展现了对教材的深刻理解。他只有一道题没有作答。Kingston在整堂课中都表现得专注而认真，摄像头也一直保持打开状态，这对他保持学习连接很有帮助。我注意到他这周因为几次短暂断线而缺席了大约8分钟的课程——如果技术问题持续出现，我们的Think客服团队可以帮助解决。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Kingston在上周关于计算长方体和立方体体积的作业中获得了92分的不错成绩。这是很好的成绩！我鼓励他观看家庭作业的解答视频，以便理解任何错误并进一步加强他的技能。\\n\\n为了继续保持这种势头，以下是一些可能有帮助的资源：\\n- Think学生应用程序中\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中提供了针对每堂课定制的额外练习题\\n- 练习册中提供了补充练习题\\n- 可以根据要求提供额外的练习题\\n- 每周二太平洋时间下午5点提供办公时间，如果Kingston需要额外支持\\n- 如果他受益于更个性化的关注，Kingston每学期可以获得3次免费的一对一辅导课程：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n你可以在他的课堂报告中找到更详细的成绩信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98Prl1\\n\\n如有任何问题，或者我可以为Kingston的学习提供任何帮助，请随时告诉我。\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

Fiona attended 74 minutes of our 90-minute class, arriving a bit late and missing about 16 minutes at the start—this likely explains why some earlier questions went unanswered, as things do come up sometimes. She also experienced 4 disconnections, one possibly during the break. To build on her strong engagement, I gently encourage you to help her arrive on time and ensure a stable connection; if technical issues persist, Think customer service can assist with troubleshooting.\\n\\nOn homework about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height, she scored an excellent 92% previously.

Strong in-class performance like his sets a great foundation, and timely homework will reinforce these skills even further.\\n\\nTo build on his success and address the unanswered question, Jasper can try the extra supplemental problems in the workbook.

She was engaged and attentive throughout our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Her camera was consistently on, and she participated actively in our discussions.\\n\\nDuring this week's in-class questions, Yilan answered 11 questions total, with 7 correct responses. She did encounter some difficulty with questions #7 and #9, and there were two questions (#2 and #10) that she didn't answer. These are great opportunities for us to focus on in the coming week.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Yilan scored 87% on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. This is solid work! I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution videos to review the problems she missed and understand the correct approaches. This will strengthen her foundation as we continue building on these concepts.\\n\\nTo support Yilan's continued growth, I recommend exploring the extra practice problems available in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module within the Think Student app, which are tailored to each lesson. The supplemental workbook also contains additional problems she can work through. If she'd like more personalized support, she's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xrnw\\n\\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to support Yilan further.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Chris，\\n\\n希望这封邮件能找到你安好。\\n\\nYilan本周在课堂上表现出色。她在分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉化简的课程中表现出了积极的参与和专注。她的摄像头始终处于打开状态，并积极参与了我们的讨论。\\n\\n在本周的课堂提问中，Yilan共回答了11道题目，其中7道正确。她在第7题和第9题遇到了一些困难，还有两道题目（第2题和第10题）没有作答。这些都是我们在下周重点关注的很好机会。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Yilan在计算长方体和立方体体积的作业中得分87%。这是扎实的成绩！我建议她观看家庭作业解答视频，复习她做错的题目，理解正确的解题方法。这将在我们继续深化这些概念时加强她的基础。\\n\\n为了支持Yilan的持续进步，我建议她利用Think Student应用中\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中的额外练习题，这些题目是针对每节课量身定制的。补充工作簿中也包含她可以练习的额外题目。如果她需要更个性化的支持，她每学期有资格获得3次免费的一对一辅导课程，你可以在这里预订：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n你可以在这里的课堂报告中找到更详细的成绩信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xrnw\\n\\n如有任何疑问，或如果有任何我可以做的事情来进一步支持Yilan，请随时与我联系。\\n\\n温暖的问候，\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

She demonstrated exceptional mastery of **multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification**, answering all 11 in-class questions correctly with zero partially correct or incorrect responses. Her engagement was consistently high—she remained attentive throughout, kept her camera on, and actively participated, which truly enhanced her learning experience.\\n\\nApril attended 89 out of 90 minutes of our 90-minute class, missing just 1 minute due to a single disconnection (one of which may relate to the break). To support her continued success, please help ensure stable attendance by troubleshooting any technical issues at home; Think customer service is available if needed.\\n\\nOn homework, April earned an impressive **96%** on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length × width × height or base area × height. To build on this strong foundation, I encourage her to review the solution videos and correct the few mistakes for deeper understanding.\\n\\nFor extra practice, she can tackle supplemental problems in the workbook, lesson-specific problems in the Think Student app’s “Learning Materials” module, or request more from me. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT in the app for homework and workbook support, with recordings available. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are also offered here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor detailed in-class performance, please review the report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdM3zP.\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in April’s growth—I’m excited for her progress!\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Linda，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。\\n\\n我很高兴分享April本周在数学课上的出色表现。她在**整数乘分数、分数乘分数以及交叉化简**方面展现了非凡的掌握力，正确回答了所有11道课堂问题，没有部分正确或错误答案。她的参与度始终很高——全程专注，摄像头一直开着，积极参与，这真正提升了她的学习体验。\\n\\nApril参加了90分钟课时的89分钟，仅因一次断线缺席1分钟（其中一次可能与休息有关）。为支持她持续成功，请帮助确保稳定的出席，通过排查家中技术问题；如需帮助，可联系Think客服。\\n\\n家庭作业方面，April在用长×宽×高或底面积×高求矩形棱柱和立方体体积的题目上取得了**96%**的出色成绩。为了在此基础上进一步巩固，我鼓励她观看作业解答视频并纠正少数错误，以加深理解。\\n\\n额外练习可尝试工作簿中的补充题、Think Student app“学习材料”模块中的课时特定练习题，或向我索取更多。周二下午5点（PDT）在app上有办公时间，提供作业和工作簿帮助，并有录像可用。本学期还有最多3次免费一对一辅导课，可在此预约：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n详细课堂表现报告请查看：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdM3zP。\\n\\n感谢您与我共同支持April的成长——我很期待她的进步！\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

Ryan has been engaged and attentive throughout our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. His camera was consistently on, and he participated actively in our class discussions.\\n\\nLooking at his in-class performance, Ryan answered 16 questions with 13 correct responses—that's an 81% accuracy rate, which shows solid understanding of the material. He did encounter some difficulty with question #12 and left questions #11 and #13 unanswered. These are areas where he might benefit from some additional practice and review.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Ryan earned a perfect 100% on his previous assignment covering volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. That's fantastic work! To continue building on this success, I'd encourage Ryan to watch the homework solution videos and use them to correct any mistakes he encounters on upcoming assignments. This practice will help reinforce his problem-solving strategies.\\n\\nTo support Ryan's continued growth, I recommend exploring these resources:\\n\\n- Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app\\n- Supplemental problems in the workbook for additional reinforcement\\n- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help\\n- Class and office hour recordings if he needs to review material at his own pace\\n\\nIf Ryan would benefit from more personalized support, he has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JwoZdl\\n\\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'm here to support Ryan's success!\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n亲爱的Roberta，\\n\\n我希望这封邮件找到你时一切安好。\\n\\n我写这封邮件是为了分享Ryan这周在数学课上的一些好消息。Ryan在我们关于分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及约分的课程中一直很投入，注意力集中。他的摄像头始终是开启的，并且积极参与了我们的课堂讨论。\\n\\n从他的课堂表现来看，Ryan回答了16个问题，其中13个正确——这是81%的准确率，表明他对这些材料有扎实的理解。他在第12题遇到了一些困难，第11题和第13题没有作答。这些是他可能受益于额外练习和复习的领域。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Ryan在之前关于长方体和立方体体积的作业中获得了满分100%。这是太棒了！为了继续建立在这一成功的基础上，我建议Ryan观看家庭作业解答视频，并用它们来改正他在即将到来的作业中遇到的任何错误。这种练习将帮助强化他的问题解决策略。\\n\\n为了支持Ryan的持续进步，我建议探索这些资源：\\n\\n- Think Student应用程序中\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中针对每节课的额外练习题\\n- 工作簿中的补充题目，用于额外的强化\\n- 每周二太平洋时间下午5点在Think Student应用程序上的办公时间，提供家庭作业和工作簿帮助\\n- 如果他需要按自己的进度复习材料，可以观看课程和办公时间的录像\\n\\n如果Ryan能从更个性化的支持中受益，他每学期可以获得最多3次免费的一对一辅导课程。你可以在这里预订课程：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n你可以在他的课堂报告中找到更详细的表现信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JwoZdl\\n\\n如果你有任何问题或疑虑，请随时与我联系。我在这里支持Ryan的成功！\\n\\n最好的问候，\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

This week in class, we focused on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. Shane was engaged and attentive throughout, keeping his camera on consistently, which really helps him stay connected with the lesson.\\n\\nHe attended 86 minutes of our 90-minute class, arriving a few minutes late and experiencing one disconnection (possibly during the break). I understand things come up sometimes, but starting on time ensures he catches key explanations, especially for early questions like #1, #8, #9, #10, and #11, which went unanswered. Gently encouraging punctuality and troubleshooting any technical glitches at home would be great—Think customer service can assist if needed.\\n\\nOut of 11 in-class questions, Shane got 5 correct and 1 incorrect (#7), showing solid grasp in spots but room to build confidence on others. For homework on **finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes** (using length x width x height or base area x height), he scored a strong 88% previously—wonderful progress! Please have him watch the solution videos to correct mistakes and solidify learning.\\n\\nTo support Shane, try extra supplemental problems in the workbook, lesson-specific practice in the Think Student app's \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module, or request more from me. Office hours are Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT for homework/workbook help, with recordings available. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can provide personalized boost: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor detailed in-class data, check the report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaE3Ge.

She demonstrated perfect mastery of the lesson topics—multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification—by answering all 11 in-class questions correctly with no errors or partial credit. Chelsea was engaged and attentive throughout, and she kept her camera consistently on, which helped her stay connected with the class. You can view more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JParE1.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Chelsea maintained her excellent streak with a perfect 100% score from the previous assignment. This week’s homework focuses on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using the formulas length x width x height or area of base x height. To reinforce her strong foundation, I encourage you to have her watch the provided homework solution videos and review any work for deeper understanding, even with her high accuracy.\\n\\nChelsea’s consistent excellence is truly commendable, and she’s building great habits for success. To keep her momentum going, consider having her tackle the extra supplemental problems in the workbook or the tailored practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module of the Think Student app. Additional problems are available upon request, and office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app offer great support for homework and workbook questions. Class and office hour recordings are also accessible if live attendance isn’t possible. For personalized boost, she can use up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester—book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your support in Chelsea’s learning journey. Please reach out with any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Yue，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。\\n\\n我很高兴与您分享本周Chelsea在我们数学课上的出色表现。她完美掌握了本课主题——分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉简化——在课堂上回答了所有11道问题，全都正确，没有错误或部分正确。Chelsea全程投入且专注，并且始终保持摄像头开启，这帮助她与班级保持联系。您可以在她的课堂报告中查看更详细的表现信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JParE1。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，Chelsea延续了她的优秀记录，上次作业得分100%。本周的作业重点是使用公式（长×宽×高或底面积×高）求矩形棱柱和立方体的体积。为了强化她的坚实基础，我鼓励您让她观看提供的家庭作业解题视频，并回顾她的作业以加深理解，即使她的准确率很高。\\n\\nChelsea一贯的卓越表现真正值得称赞，她正在养成成功的好习惯。为了保持她的势头，请考虑让她尝试工作簿中的额外补充题，或Think Student app“学习材料”模块中的针对每节课的定制练习题。如需更多题目，请随时告知。周二下午5点（PDT）在Think Student app上的办公时间提供家庭作业和工作簿问题的绝佳支持。如果无法实时参加，课堂和办公时间录像也可访问。为了个性化提升，她可以利用每学期最多3次免费一对一辅导课程——预订链接：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n感谢您对Chelsea学习之旅的支持。如有任何问题，请随时联系。\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nTeacher Omar\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

He kept his camera on throughout and was actively present for nearly the entire 90-minute lesson, missing just 2 minutes. I did notice he had 2 brief disconnections during class—one may have been during our break, but I wanted to flag this so you can help troubleshoot any technical issues on your end. If you need additional support, Think's customer service team is available to help.\\n\\nDuring our in-class practice, Vivaan answered 11 questions total, getting 7 correct. However, he struggled with questions #7, #9, and #10, and had a partially correct response on question #8. These are areas where he could use some additional focus. On the homework front, Vivaan earned an excellent 96% on the volume of rectangular prisms assignment—great work! I encourage him to review the homework solution videos to understand any corrections needed.\\n\\nTo support Vivaan's continued growth with fractions and cross-simplification, I'd like to suggest a few resources. He can access extra practice problems tailored to this week's lessons in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module within the Think Student app, or work through supplemental problems in the workbook. If he'd benefit from more personalized support, he's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. Additionally, office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg531X\\n\\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or if Vivaan needs additional resources.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n亲爱的Abhay，\\n\\n希望这封邮件能找到你安好。\\n\\n本周在课堂上，Vivaan在我们探索分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及约分时表现出了强烈的参与度和专注力。他全程保持摄像头开启，在整个90分钟的课程中几乎全程在线，仅缺席了2分钟。我注意到他在课堂期间有2次短暂的断连——其中一次可能发生在我们的休息时间，但我想提醒你这一点，以便你能帮助排查任何技术问题。如果你需要额外的支持，Think的客服团队随时可以提供帮助。\\n\\n在我们的课堂练习中，Vivaan总共回答了11个问题，其中7个正确。但是，他在第7、9和10题上遇到了困难，第8题的回答也只是部分正确。这些是他需要加强关注的领域。在家庭作业方面，Vivaan在矩形棱柱体积的作业中获得了优异的96%——做得很好！我鼓励他查看家庭作业解决方案视频，以理解任何需要更正的地方。\\n\\n为了支持Vivaan在分数和约分方面的持续进步，我想建议几个资源。他可以在Think学生应用程序的\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中访问针对本周课程的额外练习题，或在练习册中完成补充题。如果他能从更个性化的支持中受益，他每学期有资格获得最多3次免费的一对一辅导课程：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。此外，每周二太平洋时间下午5点提供办公时间，用于家庭作业和练习册帮助。\\n\\n你可以在他的课堂报告中找到更详细的表现信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg531X\\n\\n如果你有任何疑问或Vivaan需要额外的资源，请不要犹豫与我联系。\\n\\n温暖的问候，\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

Johnson was absent from this week's class on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. I understand things come up unexpectedly, and no prior notification was received, but please know I'm here to support. If scheduling conflicts arise, we can explore rescheduling or transferring class times to help him stay on track—just let me know what might work for your family.\\n\\nShifting to his homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or area of base x height, Johnson scored an impressive 92% on the previous assignment. That's a strong showing, and it reflects his solid grasp when he engages with the material. To build on this momentum, I encourage you to have him review the homework solution videos available in the Think Student app. Correcting his few mistakes there will reinforce his understanding and prepare him perfectly for the concepts we covered in class.\\n\\nSince he missed the live session, recordings of the class are available in the Learning Materials module for this lesson on the Think Student app, so he can catch up at his own pace. Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson are also attached there, along with supplemental problems in the workbook (separate from the textbook). If he'd like more, I'm happy to provide additional problems upon request. Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app offer great homework and workbook help, and recordings of those are available too. For personalized support, we offer up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester—book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nJohnson has such great potential, and with these resources, he'll be back to full speed quickly. Please reach out with any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Sara，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。\\n\\n希望您在即将到来的寒假期间一切顺利——节日活动和旅行计划总是很忙碌。Johnson本周的课堂上缺席了，课堂内容是整数乘分数、分数乘分数以及交叉化简。我理解事情有时会突然发生，而且没有事先通知，但请知道我随时在这里提供支持。如果有日程冲突，我们可以探讨重新安排或转移上课时间来帮助他保持进度——请告诉我什么适合您的家庭。\\n\\n转到他的家庭作业，主题是使用长×宽×高或底面积×高来求长方体和立方体的体积，Johnson在上次作业中得了92%的优秀分数。这是一个很棒的表现，反映出他参与材料时有坚实掌握。为了保持这种势头，我鼓励您让他观看Think Student应用中的家庭作业解题视频。纠正他少数错误将强化他的理解，并为课堂所讲概念做好完美准备。\\n\\n由于他错过了直播课程，本节课的录音可在Think Student应用的学习材料模块中获取，让他能以自己的节奏补课。每节课量身定制的额外练习题也附在那里，另外工作簿（与教科书不同）中有补充练习题。如果需要更多，我很乐意应要求提供。Think Student应用每周二太平洋时间下午5点的办公时间提供很好的家庭作业和工作簿帮助，那些的录音也可用。对于个性化支持，我们每学期提供最多3次免费一对一辅导课程——在这里预订：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\nJohnson有如此巨大的潜力，有了这些资源，他很快就会完全赶上。请随时联系任何问题。\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

I wanted to share some wonderful news about Grace's progress this week in math class.\\n\\nGrace has been consistently engaged and attentive during our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. She answered 10 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, which demonstrates a strong grasp of the material. I did notice that she found question #7 challenging and didn't answer question #11, so these are areas where a little extra practice could really help solidify her understanding.\\n\\nI'm particularly impressed with Grace's homework performance—she earned a perfect 100% on her assignment about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes. This shows she's applying the concepts we've discussed and putting in genuine effort at home.\\n\\nTo help Grace continue building confidence with the trickier concepts, I'd recommend having her watch the homework solution videos to review any mistakes and reinforce her problem-solving strategies. Additionally, Grace has access to several resources that can support her learning:\\n\\n- Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson in the Learning Materials module on the Think Student app\\n- Supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice\\n- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help\\n- Class recordings available anytime for review\\n\\nIf Grace would benefit from more personalized support, she's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nGrace is doing great work, and I'm confident that with a bit of focused practice, she'll master these skills.

Emma did a great job staying engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which really helps her participation shine.\\n\\nShe answered 12 in-class questions, getting 8 correct, which shows solid progress in grasping the new concepts. However, she had some challenges with questions #6, #9, #11, and #12. These seem to be spots where extra practice on fraction multiplication and simplification could build her confidence even more. Emma attended 89 out of 90 minutes, missing just 1 minute due to a brief disconnection—perhaps related to the break. To ensure she catches every moment, please help troubleshoot any technical issues at home; Think customer service is available if needed.\\n\\nOn homework, Emma did not complete last week's assignment on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height. I encourage her to finish it soon and stay on top of future assignments to reinforce what we're learning.\\n\\nTo support her growth, I recommend reviewing extra supplemental problems in the workbook, or the tailored practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module of the Think Student app. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help, and class/office hour recordings are available too.

He was engaged and attentive throughout class, with his camera consistently on, which shows his commitment to learning.\\n\\nDuring this week's in-class work, Lionel answered 14 out of 16 questions correctly—a strong performance overall. He did not provide answers to questions #11 and #13, which suggests he may have needed a bit more time or confidence with those particular problems. This is completely normal, and I'd encourage him to revisit those types of problems with the extra practice resources available.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Lionel earned a 96% on the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes assignment, which is excellent work. To help him continue building mastery, I'd recommend he watch the homework solution videos and take time to correct any mistakes. This reflection process really strengthens understanding.\\n\\nTo support Lionel's continued growth, here are some resources I'd like to highlight:\\n\\n- Extra practice problems tailored to each lesson are available in the Learning Materials module in the Think Student app\\n- Supplemental problems are available in the workbook\\n- Additional problems can be provided upon request\\n- Office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help\\n- Class and office hours recordings are available for flexible review\\n\\nIf Lionel would benefit from more personalized support, he has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester.

Josiah did an outstanding job overall, answering 8 out of 9 in-class questions correctly. He was engaged and attentive throughout, with his camera consistently on, which really helps him stay connected to the lesson. He missed just 2 minutes of our 90-minute class due to 1 disconnection—please encourage him to ensure continuous attendance and troubleshoot any technical issues.

To build on this, please have him watch the homework solution videos and correct his mistakes.\\n\\nFor extra practice, I recommend the supplemental problems in the workbook, or the tailored practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app. Additional problems are available upon request, and office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help.

For more details, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1NGoM.\\n\\nOn homework covering **finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes** using formulas like length x width x height or base area x height, Iris scored 85% on the previous assignment—a commendable effort that shows she's grasping the concepts. To help her solidify this, I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution videos and correct her mistakes, as this reinforces learning effectively.\\n\\nTo support Iris's growth, here are some actionable steps:\\n- Review Questions #7, #10, and #12 from class using extra supplemental problems in the workbook or practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app.\\n- Join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help—recordings are available if live attendance isn't possible.\\n- Additional problems are available upon request, and up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can provide personalized support: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nIris is making great strides, and with a bit more practice on these spots, she'll excel.

This week in class, Chloe shone brightly as we covered **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. She answered all 12 in-class questions correctly, showing fantastic grasp of the material right from the start. Her engagement was spot-on—she stayed attentive throughout, with her camera consistently on, which helped create a positive learning environment.\\n\\nThat said, Chloe arrived 2 minutes late to class and had one disconnection, which might explain why she started strong but could have missed a bit at the outset. I know things come up sometimes, and I'm sure there was a good reason. To build on her success, could you gently encourage her to join on time moving forward? For the disconnection—possibly tied to our break—please help ensure steady attendance and check for any tech glitches. Think customer service is there if needed.\\n\\nOn homework, Chloe earned a perfect **100%** on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length × width × height or base area × height—outstanding work! To reinforce this, please have her watch the solution videos and review any spots for deeper understanding.\\n\\nTo keep her momentum going, I recommend extra supplemental problems in the workbook, practice sets in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module of the Think Student app, or more upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook support, with recordings available. Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can provide personalized help: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor detailed in-class stats, check the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yoDM8.

For the in-class topics, extra supplemental problems in the workbook would be perfect targeted practice. He's also got access to extra practice problems tailored for each lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, and more are available upon request.

This week in class, we focused on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Amy did a great job staying engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which really helps her participation shine.\\n\\nOut of 12 in-class questions, she answered 9 correctly, which is solid progress, but had 2 incorrect on questions #6 and #9, and left #11 unanswered. It's clear she's grasping most concepts, and these specific spots offer great opportunities for targeted practice. Her previous homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes (using length x width x height or base area x height) was perfect at 100%—excellent work maintaining that momentum!\\n\\nTo build on her strengths and address those in-class misses, I recommend reviewing the homework solution videos together to correct any lingering errors. Extra supplemental problems in the workbook would be perfect for reinforcing fraction multiplication, as would the tailored practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app. Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT are ideal for homework or workbook support, and recordings are available if live attendance isn't possible. Additional problems are ready upon request, and up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can provide personalized help: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nAmy's enthusiasm is a joy in class, and with a bit more practice on those tricky questions, she'll be even stronger. For more details on her in-class performance, check the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Rkq3gP.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的April，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。\\n\\n希望您一切安好！本周课堂上，我们重点学习了分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉简化。Amy在整个课上保持高度参与和专注，摄像头一直开着，这真的让她参与度非常突出。\\n\\n在12道课堂问题中，她正确回答了9道，表现不错，但第6题和第9题答错了，第11题未作答。显然她掌握了大部分概念，这些具体问题提供了很好的针对性练习机会。她上次的家庭作业是关于长方体和立方体的体积计算（使用长×宽×高或底面积×高），得分100%——保持这种势头做得很好！\\n\\n为了巩固她的优势并解决课堂上的失误，我建议和她一起观看家庭作业解题视频，纠正任何遗留错误。工作簿中的额外补充题非常适合强化分数乘法，Think Student app的“学习材料”模块中的针对性练习题也很合适。每周二下午5点PDT的办公时间适合家庭作业或工作簿帮助，如果无法直播参加，有录像可用。额外题目随时可索取，本学期最多3次免费一对一辅导课可提供个性化帮助：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\nAmy的热情是课堂上的亮点，再多练习那些难题，她会更出色。更多课堂表现细节，请查看报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Rkq3gP。\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

She was engaged and attentive throughout our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Her camera was consistently on, and she actively participated in class discussions.\\n\\nThis week, Elizabeth answered 9 in-class questions with 8 correct responses. She did encounter some difficulty with Question #8, which I'd encourage her to review. Overall, her performance shows solid understanding of the material we covered.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Elizabeth earned a perfect 100% on her previous assignment about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes.

This week in class, we focused on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. Bryson was **engaged and attentive** throughout, and he kept his camera consistently on, which helped him stay connected with the group. Out of 12 in-class questions, he answered 9 correctly, which is a strong showing of his understanding of the material. He had one partially correct response on Question #10 and one incorrect on Question #9, plus he left Question #11 unanswered. These specific spots offer great opportunities for targeted practice to build his confidence even further.\\n\\nOn the homework side, covering **finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes** using formulas like length x width x height or base area x height, Bryson scored 87% on the previous assignment—a solid effort that shows good progress. To help him strengthen this, I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution videos and correct his mistakes, as reviewing them often clarifies key steps.\\n\\nTo support Bryson's growth, here are some actionable steps:\\n- Try the **extra supplemental problems** in the workbook for hands-on fraction multiplication practice.\\n- Check the **extra practice problems** tailored to each lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app.\\n- Join **office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT** on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help—recordings are available if he can't attend live.\\n- If he'd benefit from personalized guidance, book up to **3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions** per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nBryson is making great strides, and with a bit more practice on those tricky questions, he'll master these skills quickly. For more details on his in-class performance, check the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vzolGn.\\n\\nThank you, and keep up the wonderful support at home!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n尊敬的 Parent，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您时一切安好。\\n\\n希望您一切安好！本周课堂上，我们重点学习了**整数乘分数**、**分数乘分数**以及**交叉简化**。Bryson 全程**积极参与且专注**，并且他的摄像头一直开着，这帮助他与小组保持联系。在12道课堂问题中，他正确回答了9道，这显示出他对材料的良好理解。他在第#10题有一个部分正确答案，第#9题一个错误答案，并且第#11题未作答。这些具体地方为针对性练习提供了很好的机会，进一步提升他的信心。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，主题是**使用长×宽×高或底面积×高的公式求长方体和立方体的体积**，Bryson 上次作业得分为87%——这是一个扎实的努力，显示出良好的进步。为了帮助他加强这一部分，我鼓励您让他观看家庭作业解题视频并改正错误，因为复习它们通常能澄清关键步骤。\\n\\n为了支持 Bryson 的成长，以下是一些可操作的步骤：\\n- 尝试练习册中的**额外补充题**，进行分数乘法的手动练习。\\n- 查看 Think Student 应用中每个课程“学习材料”模块的**针对每节课的额外练习题**。\\n- 参加**每周二下午5点PDT 的办公时间**，在 Think Student 应用上获取家庭作业和练习册帮助——如果无法直播参加，有录像可用。\\n- 如果他需要个性化指导，可以在这里预订每学期最多**3节免费一对一辅导课**：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\nBryson 取得了很好的进步，通过多练习那些难点问题，他很快就能掌握这些技能。有关他课堂表现的更多细节，请查看此报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vzolGn。\\n\\n谢谢您，并在家继续提供精彩的支持！\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nTeacher Omar\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

It's always a pleasure to update you on Owen's progress in our math class. This week, we focused on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. Owen demonstrated strong understanding overall, answering 17 out of 19 in-class questions correctly. He was engaged and attentive throughout, with his camera consistently on, which helped him stay connected to the lesson.\\n\\nThat said, he had one incorrect answer on Question #8 and left Question #9 unanswered. These minor slips suggest he might benefit from a quick review of the concepts tested there. Additionally, Owen missed 7 minutes of our 90-minute class due to 3 disconnections—one possibly during the break. To support his continuous learning, please help ensure a stable connection moving forward. If technical issues persist, feel free to contact Think customer service for troubleshooting.\\n\\nOn a high note, Owen scored a perfect **100%** on his previous homework about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using formulas like length × width × height or base area × height. Excellent work—keep it up! I encourage him to watch the homework solution videos to reinforce his mastery.\\n\\nTo build on his success and address those in-class questions, here are some tailored recommendations:\\n- Practice extra supplemental problems in the workbook.\\n- Try the lesson-specific practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app.\\n- Join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help—recordings are available if he can't attend live.\\n- Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details on his in-class performance, check the report here: https://student-h5.thethinkacademy.com/learningReport?studentId=8269094&classId=94219&planId=497847&schoolCode=415&report_log_id=-1&skey=e0289e7e783d2a9629a4f45e0159c122.1769346893382\\n\\nOwen is thriving, and with a bit more practice, he'll be even stronger.

This week in class, we focused on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Haorui was engaged and attentive throughout, which I truly appreciate—it shows his dedication to learning.\\n\\nHe answered 11 in-class questions, getting 6 correct, 1 partially correct (Question #8), and 2 incorrect (Questions #6 and #9), with 2 unanswered (Questions #10 and #11). This is solid progress, especially on the earlier questions, and it's great to see him building confidence with these concepts. Haorui attended 82 minutes of our 90-minute class, leaving a bit early and experiencing one disconnection (possibly during the break). I understand things come up sometimes, but staying until the end would help him catch those later questions like #10 and #11. Please encourage continuous attendance and troubleshoot any technical issues—Think customer service can assist if needed.\\n\\nOn homework, Haorui did not complete last week's assignment on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes (using length x width x height or base area x height). I'd encourage him to finish it soon and prioritize timely completion moving forward to reinforce what we've covered.\\n\\nTo support his growth, especially on those trickier questions, I recommend extra supplemental problems in the workbook, practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module of the Think Student app, or additional ones upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT in the app for homework and workbook help. Class and office hour recordings are available too. For personalized support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details, check the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9LnrM1\\n\\nThank you, and I look forward to Haorui's continued success!\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n尊敬的 Parent，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您时一切安好。\\n\\n希望 Haorui 一切安好！本周课堂上，我们重点学习了分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉简化。Haorui 全程投入且专注，我非常欣赏这一点——这显示出他对学习的奉献。\\n\\n他回答了11道课堂问题，其中6道正确，1道部分正确（第8题），2道错误（第6题和第9题），2道未回答（第10题和第11题）。这是在早期问题上的扎实进步，看到他建立这些概念的信心很棒。Haorui 参加了我们90分钟课堂中的82分钟，有点早退并经历了一次断线（可能在休息时）。我理解有时事情会突然发生，但留到课结束将帮助他完成像第10题和第11题这样的后期问题。请鼓励持续出席并排查技术问题——如果需要，Think 客服可以提供帮助。\\n\\n关于作业，Haorui 没有完成上周关于求矩形棱柱和立方体体积的作业（使用长×宽×高或底面积×高公式）。我鼓励他尽快完成，并今后优先按时提交，以强化我们所学内容。\\n\\n为了支持他的成长，特别是那些较难的问题，我推荐工作簿中的额外补充题、Think Student 应用“学习材料”模块中的练习题，或按需提供更多题。周二下午5点（PDT）在应用中有办公时间，提供作业和工作簿帮助。课堂和办公时间录像也可供查看。如需个性化支持，本学期最多3次免费一对一辅导课可在此预订：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n更多细节，请查看课堂报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9LnrM1\\n\\n谢谢，并期待 Haorui 的持续进步！\\n\\n此致敬礼，  \\nTeacher Omar\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

He was engaged and attentive throughout our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. He answered 9 out of 11 in-class questions correctly, which shows solid understanding of the material. He did find questions #6 and #7 challenging, but these are great opportunities for targeted practice.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Jericho scored 88% on the volume problems using rectangular prisms and cubes. That's a strong score! I'd encourage him to review the homework solution videos to see where he can improve those few remaining items—this will help reinforce his problem-solving approach.\\n\\nTo continue building on his momentum, I'd recommend having Jericho work through some extra practice problems. The Think Student app has tailored practice problems attached to each lesson's Learning Materials module that can help him master these concepts. Additionally, our workbook has supplemental problems available if he'd like more opportunities to practice. If he has any questions about the homework or workbook, office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app.\\n\\nIf Jericho would benefit from more personalized support, he's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Overall, he has been engaged and attentive throughout our lessons on multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. I appreciate his consistent participation and the fact that he keeps his camera on during class.\\n\\nDuring this week's in-class questions, Yifeng answered 11 questions total, getting 6 correct. However, he struggled with questions #6, #7, #9, #10, and #11. This tells me he's grasping some of the core concepts but needs more practice to build confidence with the full range of problems we're covering. The good news is that his homework score remained at 100%, which shows he can apply these skills when given time to work through problems carefully.\\n\\nTo help Yifeng continue building momentum, I'd recommend having him watch the homework solution videos to review any mistakes from class practice. Additionally, he can access extra practice problems tailored to this lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module of the Think Student app. Our workbook also has supplemental problems that reinforce these concepts. If he'd like more targeted support, he's welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT, or I can provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nFor more comprehensive feedback, you can view the detailed in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5315\\n\\nIf you'd like more intensive one-on-one support, Yifeng has access to up to 3 free tutoring sessions per semester through this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to support Yifeng's learning.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的林女士/先生，\\n\\n我希望这封邮件能找到您。\\n\\n我想与您分享一下易风本周在数学课上的进展情况。总的来说，在我们讲授分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数和交叉化简的课程中，易风一直参与度高、注意力集中。我很欣赏他在课堂上的积极参与，以及他在课堂期间始终保持摄像头开启的做法。\\n\\n在本周的课堂提问中，易风共回答了11个问题，其中6个正确。但是，他在第6、7、9、10和11题上遇到了困难。这说明他正在掌握一些核心概念，但需要更多练习来增强对我们所涵盖的全面问题的信心。好消息是他的家庭作业成绩保持在100%，这表明他在有时间仔细解决问题时可以应用这些技能。\\n\\n为了帮助易风继续保持势头，我建议让他观看家庭作业解决方案视频，以复习课堂练习中的任何错误。此外，他可以在Think Student应用程序的\\\"学习材料\\\"模块中访问为本课量身定制的额外练习问题。我们的练习册还有补充问题来强化这些概念。如果他想要更有针对性的支持，他可以参加每周二太平洋时间下午5点的办公时间，或者我可以根据要求提供额外问题。\\n\\n有关更全面的反馈，您可以在此处查看详细的课堂报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5315\\n\\n如果您希望获得更密集的一对一支持，易风每学期可以获得3次免费辅导课程，链接如下：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n如果您有任何问题或我可以做任何其他事情来支持易风的学习，请随时告诉我。\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

This week in class, Siyan and her classmates explored multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. She demonstrated strong engagement, staying attentive throughout and keeping her camera on consistently, which helped her participate fully.\\n\\nSiyan answered 11 in-class questions, getting 9 correct—a solid performance that shows she's grasping these concepts well overall. She had a couple of slips on questions #2 and #9, so reviewing those specific areas will help solidify her understanding. For more details, you can check the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn53xZ.\\n\\nShe attended nearly the full 90-minute class, missing just 1 minute due to a brief disconnection. To ensure she catches every moment, please help troubleshoot any technical issues at home—Think customer service is available if needed.\\n\\nOn homework about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or base area x height, Siyan scored a perfect 100%—outstanding work! Please encourage her to watch the solution videos anyway to reinforce her success.\\n\\nTo build on this momentum, I recommend extra practice with the supplemental problems in her workbook or the tailored practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module of the Think Student app. Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT are great for homework or workbook help, and class/office hour recordings are available too. Additional problems are ready upon request. If she'd benefit from personalized support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nI'm proud of Siyan's progress and excited for her continued growth.

It's Teacher Omar here with Audrey's weekly update from our math class. We covered multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification this week, and I was happy to see her staying engaged and attentive throughout with her camera consistently on—that really helps everyone connect!\\n\\nIn class, Audrey answered 12 questions, getting 3 correct. She had some challenges with questions #1 and #5 (incorrect) and left #6 through #12 unanswered. No worries at all—I noticed she fell asleep during part of the lesson. Was she feeling under the weather or just extra tired that day? It's completely understandable, and she can easily catch up by watching the class recording anytime.\\n\\nOn homework about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes (using length x width x height or base area x height), she scored 72% last time—a solid effort! I'd encourage you to have her watch the solution videos to review and correct her mistakes; that'll build her confidence quickly.\\n\\nTo support her progress, here are some tailored recommendations:\\n- Review extra supplemental problems in the workbook (separate from the textbook).\\n- Check the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module in the Think Student app for lesson-specific practice problems.\\n- Join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the app for homework and workbook help.\\n- Class and office hour recordings are always available.\\n- Book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details on her in-class performance, check the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/J31roz. Audrey's got such great potential—looking forward to her shining next week!\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的Rachel，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。\\n\\n希望您一切安好，Rachel！我是Omar老师，给您发Audrey本周数学课的反馈。我们本周学习了分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉简化，高兴地看到她全程参与且注意力集中，摄像头一直开着——这真的有助于大家互动！\\n\\n课堂上，Audrey回答了12道题，正确3道。她在第1题和第5题（错误）上有一些挑战，第6至12题未作答。完全没关系——我注意到她上课时睡着了。她那天是生病了还是特别累？这是完全可以理解的，她可以随时观看课堂录像补上错过的部分。\\n\\n关于矩形棱柱和立方体的体积计算作业（使用长×宽×高或底面积×高公式），她上次的得分是72%——不错的努力！建议您让她观看作业解答视频，复习并改正错误；这会很快提升她的信心。\\n\\n为了支持她的进步，这里有一些针对性的建议：\\n- 复习工作簿中的额外补充题（与教科书不同）。\\n- 在Think Student app的“学习材料”模块查看每节课的特定练习题。\\n- 每周二下午5点（PDT）参加app上的办公时间，获取作业和工作簿帮助。\\n- 课堂和办公时间录像随时可用。\\n- 本学期可预约最多3次免费一对一辅导：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n更多课堂表现细节，请查看报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/J31roz。Audrey潜力巨大——期待她下周大放光彩！\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼  \\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

He remained attentive throughout with his camera consistently on, contributing positively to our discussions.\\n\\nThat said, John had some challenges with questions #9, #10 (partially correct), and #11. These moments highlight opportunities for targeted practice on the week's topics to build even greater confidence. His previous homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using formulas like length x width x height or base area x height scored 81%, a respectable mark that we can aim to improve.\\n\\nTo support his progress, I encourage you to have John watch the homework solution videos and correct his mistakes there—this hands-on review often leads to big gains. Additional practice is available through extra supplemental problems in the workbook, lesson-specific problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, or more upon request.

This week we covered multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification—important foundational skills that will support his future math learning.\\n\\nNathan was engaged and attentive during class, which I really appreciated. However, I noticed he arrived late and missed about 64 minutes of our 90-minute session. He also had one brief disconnection during class. Because of these attendance gaps, he wasn't able to attempt the first five in-class questions (#1-5), which covered key concepts from the lesson. Of the remaining questions he engaged with, he answered three correctly, which shows he's grasping the material when he's present.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Nathan earned a perfect 100% on his previous assignment—excellent work! I'd encourage him to continue watching the solution videos for any questions he finds tricky, as this is a great way to reinforce his understanding.\\n\\nTo help Nathan stay on track, I'd like to gently encourage you to help him arrive on time and maintain consistent attendance throughout class. If there are any technical issues causing disconnections, please reach out to Think customer service for support. Additionally, Nathan has access to several resources to strengthen his skills: extra practice problems in the workbook and tailored practice problems in the Learning Materials module. He can also attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help, or book a free 1-on-1 tutoring session at https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/ if he needs more personalized support.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JOwrMq\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Nathan's learning!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n亲爱的家长，\\n\\n希望这封邮件能找到您安好。\\n\\n内森这周在数学课上表现不错，我想和您分享一些关于他进度的具体反馈。这周我们学习了用整数乘以分数、分数乘以分数以及约分——这些都是重要的基础技能，将支持他未来的数学学习。\\n\\n内森在课堂上表现得很专注和认真，我非常欣赏这一点。不过，我注意到他迟到了，错过了我们90分钟课堂中的约64分钟。他在课堂期间还有一次短暂的掉线。由于这些出席情况，他无法尝试前五道课堂问题（#1-5），这些问题涵盖了课程中的关键概念。在他参与的其余问题中，他有三道答对了，这表明他在课堂上时正在掌握这些内容。\\n\\n在家庭作业方面，内森在之前的作业中获得了完美的100%——做得很好！我建议他继续观看他觉得困难的问题的解答视频，因为这是加强理解的好方法。\\n\\n为了帮助内森保持进度，我想温和地建议您帮助他按时到达并在整个课堂期间保持持续出席。如果有任何技术问题导致掉线，请与Think客服联系寻求支持。此外，内森可以使用多项资源来加强他的技能：练习册中的额外练习题和学习材料模块中的定制练习题。他也可以参加每周二太平洋时间下午5点的办公时间进行家庭作业和练习册帮助，或者可以在 https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/ 预订免费的一对一辅导课程，如果他需要更个性化的支持。\\n\\n您可以在他的课堂报告中找到更详细的成绩信息：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JOwrMq\\n\\n感谢您在支持内森学习中的合作！\\n\\n温暖的问候，\\n奥马尔老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

Out of 11 in-class questions, he answered 10 correctly and only missed Question #6, showing excellent grasp of the material overall. He was engaged and attentive throughout, with his camera consistently on, which helped him stay connected to the lesson.\\n\\nThat said, Ethan missed 9 minutes of our 90-minute class due to 2 disconnections—one possibly during the break.

This week in class, we focused on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification**. Isaac did an excellent job overall, answering 11 in-class questions with 9 correct. He was engaged and attentive throughout, and kept his camera on consistently, which helped him stay connected to the lesson.\\n\\nThat said, he arrived about 10 minutes late, which likely explains why he didn't answer Question #1 and got Question #6 incorrect. I understand things come up sometimes, but helping him arrive on time will ensure he catches all the key explanations from the start. He also had 2 disconnections—one possibly during the break—so please troubleshoot any technical issues at home. If needed, reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nOn homework about finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes (using length x width x height or base area x height), Isaac scored an impressive 96% previously. Great work—please have him watch the solution videos to correct his few mistakes.\\n\\nTo build on his strong performance, I recommend extra supplemental problems in the workbook, practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app, or more upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework and workbook help. Class and office hour recordings are available, and up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor detailed in-class performance, check the report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaE3ze.

This week in class, we focused on **multiplying fractions by whole numbers**, **multiplying fractions by fractions**, and **cross-simplification**. Belinda showed outstanding performance, answering 10 out of 11 in-class questions correctly with no partially correct or incorrect responses. She only left Question #11 unanswered, which is a minor gap we can easily address. Throughout the lesson, she was engaged and attentive, and she kept her camera consistently on, which helped create a positive learning environment for everyone.\\n\\nOn homework covering **finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes** using formulas like length x width x height or area of base x height, Belinda earned an impressive 90%—a strong result that reflects her solid understanding. To build on this success and ensure mastery, I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution videos and correct her mistakes. This targeted review will reinforce key concepts and boost her confidence.\\n\\nBelinda's attentiveness and high accuracy are truly commendable, and with a bit more practice on those few unanswered spots, she'll be even stronger. Here are some tailored resources to support her:\\n- Extra supplemental problems in the workbook.\\n- Extra practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module for each lesson in the Think Student app.\\n- Additional problems available upon request.\\n- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help.\\n- Recordings of classes and office hours if she can't attend live.\\n- Up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, please check the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JMDr3Z.

She answered 12 in-class questions, getting 11 correct and just 1 incorrect on Question #9. Iris was engaged and attentive throughout, with her camera consistently on, which helped her stay connected to the lesson.\\n\\nFor homework on finding the volume of rectangular prisms and cubes using length x width x height or area of base x height, Iris earned an excellent 99%—building on her previous high score. To make it even stronger, I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution videos and correct any mistakes, as this reinforces key concepts.\\n\\nIris is doing wonderfully overall, and with a little targeted practice on that one in-class question, she'll solidify her skills. Here are some actionable steps:\\n- Try extra supplemental problems in the workbook.\\n- Access extra practice problems in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module for the lesson in the Think Student app.\\n- Join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help.\\n- Review class recordings if needed.\\n\\nIf she'd benefit from personalized support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more details, check the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JjL35Y.\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in Iris's learning—I'm excited for her continued success!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的家长，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。\\n\\n我很高兴分享Iris在本周数学课上的出色表现，课程内容包括**整数乘分数、分数乘分数以及交叉化简**。她在课堂上回答了12道题，正确11道，仅Question #9一道错误。Iris全程投入且专注，摄像头一直开启，这帮助她更好地参与课程。\\n\\n关于家庭作业——使用长×宽×高或底面积×高求矩形棱柱和立方体的体积，Iris取得了优秀的99%成绩——延续了她之前的高分。为了进一步巩固，我建议您让她观看家庭作业解题视频并纠正错误，这能强化关键概念。\\n\\nIris整体表现非常棒，通过针对那道课堂题的少量练习，她将能巩固技能。以下是一些可操作建议：\\n- 尝试练习册中的额外补充题。\\n- 在Think Student app的课程“学习材料”模块中获取每节课量身定制的额外练习题。\\n- 每周二太平洋时间下午5点加入Think Student app的办公时间，获取家庭作业和练习册帮助。\\n- 如需复习，可查看课堂录音。\\n\\n如果她需要个性化支持，本学期可免费获得最多3次一对一辅导课程，请在此预订：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\n更多细节，请查看课堂报告：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JjL35Y。\\n\\n感谢您在Iris学习中的合作——我期待她持续的成功！\\n\\n此致\\n敬礼，\\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",

I wanted to share a quick update on Owen's strong progress in our recent math class.\\n\\nOwen demonstrated excellent engagement this week, staying attentive throughout and keeping his camera on consistently, which helped him participate fully. We covered multiplying fractions by whole numbers, multiplying fractions by fractions, and cross-simplification. Out of 12 in-class questions, he answered 9 correctly, with just 1 incorrect (Question #11) and 2 unanswered (Questions #8 and #10). This shows he has a solid grasp of the material overall, and his high accuracy rate is something to celebrate—it's clear he's building confidence with these concepts.\\n\\nTo help him strengthen those specific areas, I recommend reviewing Questions #8, #10, and #11 from the in-class report, available here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97MND1. Extra supplemental problems in the workbook would be perfect for targeted practice, as would the extra practice problems tailored for each lesson in the \\\"Learning Materials\\\" module on the Think Student app. If he'd like more, additional problems are available upon request. Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are great for workbook help, and recordings of classes and office hours are accessible if you miss live sessions. For personalized support, up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester can make a big difference: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nOwen's dedication is paying off, and with a bit more practice on those spots, he'll master this unit seamlessly. Please let me know if you have any questions—I'm here to support his success.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n亲爱的家长，\\n\\n希望这封邮件找到您一切安好。我想分享一下Owen在本周数学课上的出色进步。\\n\\nOwen在本周表现出色，积极参与课堂，全程专注且摄像头一直开启，这让他能够充分参与。我们学习了分数乘以整数、分数乘以分数以及交叉简化。在12道课堂问题中，他正确回答了9道，仅1道错误（第11题），2道未作答（第8题和第10题）。这表明他对材料整体掌握得很好，他的高准确率值得庆祝——显然他在这些概念上越来越自信了。\\n\\n为了帮助他加强这些特定领域，我建议回顾课堂报告中的第8、10和11题，报告链接在这里：https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97MND1。练习册中的额外补充题非常适合针对性练习，Think Student app的“学习材料”模块中也有每节课量身定制的额外练习题。如果需要更多，随时可以请求。Think Student app每周二下午5点（PDT）的办公时间很适合练习册帮助，如果错过直播课，课堂和办公时间的录音也可用。对于个性化支持，本学期最多3次免费一对一辅导课会带来很大帮助：https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/。\\n\\nOwen的努力正在见效，再多练习那些地方，他就能轻松掌握这个单元了。如果您有任何问题，请随时告诉我——我随时支持他的成功。\\n\\n此致  \\n敬礼，  \\nOmar老师\"},\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",
