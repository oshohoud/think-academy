    "5. There is no need to mention detailed attendance data (e.g. how many minutes the student did or did not attend) if the student attended the entire lesson or was entirely absent.\n",
    "6. If the student was partially absent, describe attendance data in minutes, not percentages. Since the full class time is 90 minutes, you would say to the parent of a child who missed 10% of the class that the child \"missed 9 minutes of class\". Round to the nearest minute.\n",
    "7. Unless otherwise specified in the above instructions, mention and comment on the student's homework score (as a percentage). If the student did not complete the homework, say they did not complete it and encourage them to complete it. Do not provide feedback about specific questions on the homework, since that information is not available to you\n",
    "8. Provide actionable recommendations based on the data\n",
    "9. If student was absent, focus on homework feedback and offer catch-up resources\n",
    "10. If provided above, include the in-class report link at the end of the email and mention to the parent they can find more detailed performance information in it.\n",
    "11. Be encouraging but honest about areas needing improvement\n",
    "12. Include relevant resources based on student's needs. If recommending 1-on-1 tutoring, include the tutoring link in the email.\n",
    "13. Keep tone warm, professional, and personalized\n",
    "14. Keep the feedback part (not including extra section) between 200-300 words. If the extra section is present, it should be written ABOVE/BEFORE the main email body and is not included in the word count. If an extra section was not mentioned, ignore this instruction.\n",
    "15. Do NOT use generic template language\n",
    "16. Do NOT include a subject at the top of the email body\n",
    "17. Do NOT use asterisks ** to indicate bold, this is for markdown and does not work for plain text.\n",
    "18. After the English email, write the exact same email translated into Mandarin Chinese.\n",

She was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which really helped her stay focused.\\n\\nThis week, we covered plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Peggy answered 12 in-class questions, getting 10 correct. She struggled a bit with question #9 and left question #3 unanswered. These are good opportunities for her to review the concepts we discussed to build stronger confidence.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtracting mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators, Peggy scored 62%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video carefully and correct any mistakes she finds. This will help solidify her understanding, especially the borrowing technique from the whole number.\\n\\nTo support her further, she can practice extra problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional exercises upon request. Office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can ask questions about homework or workbook problems. Also, remember she has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about her in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/94xq5a.\\n\\nThank you for your support at home.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear David,\\n\\nI hope you and your family are having a wonderful Thanksgiving break. I wanted to share some feedback about Katherine\\u2019s performance in math class this week. She was engaged and attentive throughout our lessons, and I appreciate that she kept her camera on, which helps create a positive learning environment.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Katherine answered 12 questions in class, with 5 correct, 1 partially correct, and 4 incorrect. She did not answer 2 questions. The questions she struggled with were #4, #5, #9, and #12, and she left #3 and #11 unanswered. I encourage her to review the class recording and the in-class report for more details on these questions.\\n\\nHer homework on subtracting mixed numbers was scored at 81%. I recommend that Katherine watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes to reinforce her understanding. If she needs more practice, I can provide additional problems or she can work on the extra supplemental problems in the workbook.\\n\\nFor extra support, our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings are available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. Katherine is also welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vAmqKK.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support!\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u4e0b\\u4e00\\u5468\\u5c06\\u6062\\u590d\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684David\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u548c\\u60a8\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u4eba\\u5ea6\\u8fc7\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u6109\\u5feb\\u7684\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5047\\u671f\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bKatherine\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u65f6\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u5979\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u8425\\u9020\\u79ef\\u6781\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u6c1b\\u56f4\\u3002\\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u51fa\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u7528\\u5b83\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u800c\\u4e0d\\u662f\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u3002Katherine\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d5\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u9053\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c4\\u9053\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u67092\\u9053\\u9898\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\u3002\\u5979\\u7b54\\u9519\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u662f\\u7b2c4\\u30015\\u30019\\u548c12\\u9898\\uff0c\\u672a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7684\\u662f\\u7b2c3\\u548c11\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u56de\\u987e\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u548c\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff0c\\u4e86\\u89e3\\u66f4\\u591a\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u7684\\u7ec6\\u8282\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff08\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\uff09\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a81%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeKatherine\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5979\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u5979\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u505a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\uff0c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u540c\\u5b66\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u3002Katherine\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vAmqKK\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\nTeacher Omar\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share an update on Travis\\u2019s progress in our recent math lessons. This week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines for prediction, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nTravis participated actively in class and kept his camera on throughout, showing strong engagement. He answered 12 in-class questions, with 9 correct, 1 partially correct (question #3), 1 incorrect (question #7), and 1 unanswered (question #1). The unanswered and some earlier questions may be related to Travis arriving about 2 minutes late to class. I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances arise, but I encourage supporting Travis to attend on time to avoid missing important introductions.\\n\\nThere was also one brief disconnection during class, possibly related to our scheduled break. Please ensure a stable connection for Travis and don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Think customer service if needed.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Travis did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from the whole number. Completing homework on time is essential to reinforce class concepts, so please encourage him to catch up and submit future assignments promptly. Extra practice problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nTo support Travis further, he is welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework and workbook help.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Hui,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to reach out with some positive feedback about Ruiyan's performance in this week's math class.\\n\\nRuiyan demonstrated excellent engagement throughout our lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, finding trend lines, and understanding when to use different graph types. She was attentive, kept her camera on consistently, and answered all 10 in-class questions correctly. This kind of focused participation shows she's genuinely invested in her learning, and I'm really impressed by her performance in class.\\n\\nHowever, I did notice that Ruiyan did not complete her homework from last week on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I want to gently encourage her to complete this assignment, as homework is crucial for reinforcing the concepts we cover in class. Moving forward, completing assignments on time will help her build confidence and mastery in these foundational skills.\\n\\nTo support Ruiyan's continued success, I'd like to remind you of the resources available to her:\\n- Extra supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice\\n- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help\\n- Free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions (up to 3 per semester) available here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n- Recordings of all classes and office hours for review\\n\\nI'd recommend having Ruiyan complete last week's homework and stay on top of future assignments. If she needs extra support with mixed number subtraction, our Tuesday office hours or tutoring sessions would be perfect opportunities.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1N1rD\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in Ruiyan's learning!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u5230 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u5173\\u95ed\\uff0c\\u5e86\\u795d\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684 Hui\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u4f60\\u53cd\\u9988\\u4e00\\u4e0b Ruiyan \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\n\\nRuiyan \\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u5bfb\\u627e\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u56fe\\u8868\\u7c7b\\u578b\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u6781\\u597d\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5979\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u542f\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86\\u5168\\u90e8 10 \\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u79cd\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u65b9\\u5f0f\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u771f\\u6b63\\u6295\\u5165\\u4e8e\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5bf9\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5370\\u8c61\\u6df1\\u523b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230 Ruiyan \\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u6e29\\u548c\\u5730\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u9879\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5b66\\u5230\\u7684\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u81f3\\u5173\\u91cd\\u8981\\u3002\\u5c55\\u671b\\u672a\\u6765\\uff0c\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u5e76\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Ruiyan \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u63d0\\u9192\\u4f60\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u7684\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff1a\\n- \\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u7528\\u4e8e\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\n- \\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\n- \\u514d\\u8d39 1 \\u5bf9 1 \\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff08\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\uff09\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u5728\\u6b64\\u9884\\u8ba2\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n- \\u6240\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u97f3\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u590d\\u4e60\\n\\n\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae Ruiyan \\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u672a\\u6765\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u5728\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u65b9\\u9762\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u6216\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5c06\\u662f\\u5b8c\\u7f8e\\u7684\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1N1rD\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u4f60\\u5728 Ruiyan \\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5408\\u4f5c\\u4e0e\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

He was engaged and attentive throughout our lessons, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on, which helps us stay connected during class. Quinn answered 12 questions in class, getting 9 correct and 3 incorrect (questions #3, #10, and #12). These were all related to our topic of line graphs, trend lines, and choosing the best graph type. He\\u2019s doing well overall, but I encourage him to review those questions to strengthen his understanding.\\n\\nQuinn did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers. I encourage him to finish it as soon as possible and to make a habit of completing homework on time. Staying current with assignments will help him build confidence and keep up with our class pace.\\n\\nIf Quinn would like extra practice, I recommend the supplemental problems in the workbook. Additional problems are also available upon request.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Jesmine,\\n\\nI hope you and your family are having a wonderful Thanksgiving break. I wanted to share some feedback about Andrea\\u2019s performance in math class this week. She was engaged and attentive throughout our lesson on line graphs, and I appreciate that she kept her camera on, which helps foster a strong classroom community.\\n\\nAndrea answered 12 in-class questions this week, getting 8 correct and 4 incorrect. The questions she missed were #3, #5, #9, and #12. While she\\u2019s doing well overall, these questions suggest she could benefit from a bit more practice interpreting and drawing trend lines on line graphs. I encourage her to review the class recordings and try the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, which will help reinforce these concepts.\\n\\nHer most recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers was strong\\u2014she scored 95%. I recommend she watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to deepen her understanding. If she needs more practice, I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems.\\n\\nAndrea is welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework or workbook help. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if she can\\u2019t attend live. If she would like extra support, she can book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can view her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9WaA0W.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support!\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u4e0b\\u4e00\\u5468\\u5c06\\u6062\\u590d\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Jesmine\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u548c\\u60a8\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u4eba\\u5ea6\\u8fc7\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u6109\\u5feb\\u7684\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5047\\u671f\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bAndrea\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u5979\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u8425\\u9020\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u6c1b\\u56f4\\u3002\\n\\nAndrea\\u672c\\u5468\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d8\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c4\\u9053\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u5979\\u7b54\\u9519\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u662f\\u7b2c3\\u30015\\u30019\\u548c12\\u9898\\u3002\\u867d\\u7136\\u5979\\u6574\\u4f53\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4e0d\\u9519\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5728\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u548c\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4e0a\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u591a\\u52a0\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u590d\\u4e60\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u5f55\\u50cf\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u597d\\uff0c\\u5f97\\u520695%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5f88\\u4e50\\u610f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\n\\nAndrea\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9WaA0W\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear June,\\n\\nI hope you and your family are having a wonderful Thanksgiving break. I wanted to share some feedback about Maxwell\\u2019s recent progress in math class.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Maxwell was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and he kept his camera on, which is always appreciated. He answered 12 questions in class, getting 7 correct and 5 incorrect. The questions he missed were #5, #8, #9, #11, and #12. These are all good opportunities for Maxwell to review the concepts and practice more, especially with interpreting graphs and drawing trend lines.\\n\\nMaxwell did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers. I encourage him to finish it as soon as possible and to make completing homework on time a priority moving forward. Staying current with assignments will help him build confidence and reinforce what we\\u2019re learning in class.\\n\\nIf Maxwell would like extra practice, I recommend working through the supplemental problems in the workbook. Additional problems are also available upon request. For extra support, our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings of classes and office hours are available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. Maxwell is also welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can view Maxwell\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMd8y.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there\\u2019s anything else I can do to support Maxwell\\u2019s learning.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u4e0b\\u4e00\\u5468\\u5c06\\u6062\\u590d\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684June\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u548c\\u60a8\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u4eba\\u5ea6\\u8fc7\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u6109\\u5feb\\u7684\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5047\\u671f\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bMaxwell\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\n\\n\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u51fa\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u7528\\u5b83\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u5728\\u4ec0\\u4e48\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u4e0b\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6bd4\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u66f4\\u5408\\u9002\\u3002Maxwell\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u503c\\u5f97\\u80af\\u5b9a\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e867\\u9053\\uff0c\\u7b54\\u9519\\u4e865\\u9053\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u7b54\\u9519\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u662f\\u7b2c5\\u30018\\u30019\\u300111\\u548c12\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u4e3aMaxwell\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u4e86\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u590d\\u4e60\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u5728\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u56fe\\u8868\\u548c\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u65b9\\u9762\\u3002\\n\\nMaxwell\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u5c3d\\u5feb\\u5b8c\\u6210\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5728\\u4eca\\u540e\\u4f18\\u5148\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5b66\\u5230\\u7684\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cMaxwell\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\uff0c\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u540c\\u5b66\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u3002Maxwell\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bMaxwell\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMd8y\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u4e3aMaxwell\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u5176\\u4ed6\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Lillian was engaged and attentive throughout class, keeping her camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nShe participated actively by answering 12 in-class questions, with 7 correct, 1 partially correct (question #1), and 1 incorrect (question #9). She did not answer questions #3, #4, and #5. These particular questions might be good starting points for additional review to strengthen her understanding.  \\n\\nRegarding homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, Lillian scored 77%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to review and correct her mistakes; this will help solidify her skills in borrowing from the whole number when necessary.\\n\\nTo support her further, she can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Kelsie,\\n\\nI hope you\\u2019re having a wonderful week! I wanted to share some feedback about Thea\\u2019s progress in math class. This week, we focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, how to draw trend lines and use them to predict future values, and when it\\u2019s best to use a line graph versus a bar graph. Thea was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and she kept her camera on, which is always appreciated.\\n\\nIn class, Thea answered 12 questions, getting 8 correct, 2 incorrect (questions #8 and #12), and did not answer 2 (questions #1 and #3). She\\u2019s doing well overall, but I encourage her to keep practicing interpreting graphs and drawing trend lines, especially since those were the topics of the questions she missed. The in-class report with more details is available here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5apB.\\n\\nHer homework score was 69%. I recommend that Thea watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes to reinforce her understanding. If she needs more practice, there are extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nFor extra support, office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings are available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. Thea is also welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support!\\n\\nWarmly,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u4e00\\u5c06\\u6062\\u590d\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Kelsie\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u672c\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bThea\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u51fa\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u7528\\u5b83\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u7684\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u5728\\u4ec0\\u4e48\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u4e0b\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6bd4\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u66f4\\u5408\\u9002\\u3002Thea\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u800c\\u4e14\\u5979\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u503c\\u5f97\\u80af\\u5b9a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0cThea\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d8\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c2\\u9053\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c8\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u67092\\u9053\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u5979\\u6574\\u4f53\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4e0d\\u9519\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u56fe\\u8868\\u548c\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6b63\\u662f\\u5979\\u505a\\u9519\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u6240\\u6d89\\u53ca\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u8bf7\\u89c1\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5apB\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a69%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeThea\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u8ba2\\u6b63\\u81ea\\u5df1\\u7684\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u540c\\u5b66\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u3002Thea\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\nTeacher Omar\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Ting,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Joyce's progress in math this week.\\n\\nJoyce was fully engaged during our lessons on line graphs and trend lines. She demonstrated strong focus, kept her camera on throughout class, and participated actively. Out of 13 in-class questions, she answered 9 correctly, which shows solid understanding of the material. I did notice she found questions #6, #10, and #11 challenging, and she didn't attempt question #12. These are areas where Joyce might benefit from some additional practice to build confidence.\\n\\nOn her homework about subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, Joyce scored 88%\\u2014a strong performance! I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution video to review the questions she missed so she can learn from those mistakes and strengthen her skills.\\n\\nHere are some ways I'd like to support Joyce's continued growth:\\n\\n- Review the supplemental problems in the workbook for extra practice on topics she found tricky\\n- Attend office hours next Tuesday at 5 PM PDT (available on the Think Student app) where we can work through any questions together\\n- If she'd like more personalized support, Joyce qualifies for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nJoyce is on a great trajectory, and with a little extra focus on the challenging concepts, she'll continue to build her confidence in math. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can review the in-class report here: https://student-h5.thethinkacademy.com/learningReport?studentId=8292213&classId=88376&planId=465757&schoolCode=415&report_log_id=-1&skey=68e33205ab717fc60c1b46124d80542e.1764211015122\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f311\\u670830\\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u95ed\\u6821\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Ting\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5047\\u671f\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5173\\u4e8eJoyce\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u7684\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nJoyce\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5145\\u5206\\u7684\\u6295\\u5165\\u3002\\u5979\\u5c55\\u73b0\\u4e86\\u5f3a\\u70c8\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u529b\\uff0c\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u542f\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u3002\\u572813\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e869\\u9053\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u6240\\u5b66\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u6709\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c6\\u300110\\u548c11\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u800c\\u4e14\\u5979\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u662fJoyce\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u6765\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u7684\\u9886\\u57df\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\uff0cJoyce\\u5f97\\u520688%\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5979\\u505a\\u9519\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6837\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4ece\\u9519\\u8bef\\u4e2d\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u81ea\\u5df1\\u7684\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u6211\\u60f3\\u652f\\u6301Joyce\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u65b9\\u5f0f\\uff1a\\n\\n- \\u590d\\u4e60\\u8865\\u5145\\u6559\\u6750\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u4fbf\\u5728\\u5979\\u89c9\\u5f97\\u56f0\\u96be\\u7684\\u4e3b\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\n- \\u53c2\\u52a0\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff08\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\uff09\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\n- \\u5982\\u679cJoyce\\u60f3\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u8d44\\u683c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nJoyce\\u6b63\\u5728\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u5bf9\\u5177\\u6709\\u6311\\u6218\\u6027\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u5173\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u5979\\u5c06\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u4e2d\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\uff01\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u4e86\\u89e3\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://student-h5.thethinkacademy.com/learningReport?studentId=8292213&classId=88376&planId=465757&schoolCode=415&report_log_id=-1&skey=68e33205ab717fc60c1b46124d80542e.1764211015122\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

She was engaged and attentive in class, consistently keeping her camera on and participating actively.

These are small areas to review, and I encourage her to revisit those concepts using the in-class report, which you can access here: https://student-h5.thethinkacademy.com/learningReport?studentId=8103857&classId=88376&planId=465757&schoolCode=415&report_log_id=-1&skey=ac5cd7901de71f6d21e6ca8d9b8d0614.1764211050116.\\n\\nEva\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers was completed with a perfect score of 100%.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Ling,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Isabel has had a strong week in class, showing great engagement and attentiveness throughout our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when line graphs are more appropriate than bar graphs. She consistently kept her camera on, which helped maintain her focus.\\n\\nShe answered 12 in-class questions and got 10 correct, with no partially correct or incorrect answers, which is excellent. However, Isabel did not answer questions #3 and #5. These missed questions may indicate areas where she could benefit from a bit more review or practice, so I encourage her to revisit those specific problems when possible.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Isabel scored 86% on subtraction of mixed numbers with both like and unlike denominators. To strengthen her skills further, it would be helpful if she watches the homework solution video and corrects any mistakes she made. This reflection can deepen her understanding, especially for borrowing from the whole number during subtraction.\\n\\nPlease remind her that extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook if she wants more practice, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook help. Recordings of classes and office hours are available for review if she cannot attend live.\\n\\nIf you feel Isabel would benefit from more personalized support, remember she has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can view her in-class performance report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXqn8.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support in Isabel\\u2019s learning journey.

Since Jayden missed the lesson, I recommend reviewing the class recordings and using the extra supplemental problems in the workbook to reinforce these concepts. Additional problems are available upon request, and I\\u2019m also happy to support Jayden during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Jayden did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from the whole number when needed. Completing this homework will be important for building a strong foundation. Please encourage Jayden to submit it as soon as possible and to try to complete homework on time in the future.\\n\\nIf you feel Jayden would benefit from more personalized support, remember that up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions are available each semester.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Sara,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Jerry's progress in this week's math lessons on line graphs.\\n\\nJerry demonstrated strong engagement and focus throughout our sessions. He answered 12 in-class questions with impressive accuracy, getting 9 completely correct. I did notice he had some difficulty with Question #10 and a partially correct response on Question #3, which suggests he may benefit from some additional practice with specific concepts we covered this week. These are great opportunities for targeted review.\\n\\nOn the homework side, Jerry scored 87% on the mixed number subtraction problems. While this is solid work, I'd encourage him to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes he made. This will help reinforce his understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nHere are some resources that can support Jerry's continued growth:\\n\\n- Extra supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice\\n- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help\\n- Class and office hour recordings if he needs to review material\\n- Free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions (up to 3 per semester): https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nI'm confident Jerry will continue making great progress. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can view Jerry's in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWq51\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Sara\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab\\u5173\\u4e8eJerry\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nJerry\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5f3a\\u70c8\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u548c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u529b\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u51c6\\u786e\\u5ea6\\u4ee4\\u4eba\\u5370\\u8c61\\u6df1\\u523b\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d9\\u9053\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\u7684\\u56de\\u7b54\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u5bf9\\u672c\\u5468\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u7684\\u7279\\u5b9a\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u662f\\u6709\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u6027\\u590d\\u4e60\\u7684\\u5f88\\u597d\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cJerry\\u5728\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u5f97\\u520687%\\u3002\\u867d\\u7136\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u4ed6\\u72af\\u7684\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u524d\\u8fdb\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u652f\\u6301Jerry\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u7684\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff1a\\n\\n- \\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u7528\\u4e8e\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\n- \\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u6807\\u51c6\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\n- \\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u5f55\\u97f3\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u9700\\u8981\\u590d\\u4e60\\u6750\\u6599\\n- \\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff08\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\uff09\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1Jerry\\u5c06\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u826f\\u597d\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u5904\\u67e5\\u770bJerry\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWq51\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Han has been doing a wonderful job in class this week, showing strong engagement and attentiveness throughout our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. She answered 11 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, with only question #3 left unanswered, which is a solid performance and reflects her focus during our session. I also appreciate that Han kept her camera on consistently, which helps maintain her connection with the class.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Han scored 58% on the recent assignment about subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from the whole number when needed. This area seems to need some extra practice. I encourage Han to watch the homework solution video carefully and correct her mistakes, which will help reinforce her understanding. Additionally, there are extra supplemental problems in the workbook that she can work through for more practice. If you would like, I can also provide additional problems tailored to her needs.\\n\\nPlease remind Han that office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, which is a great opportunity for her to get help with homework or workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if she cannot attend live. If you feel Han would benefit from more personalized support, remember that she is eligible for up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about Han\\u2019s in-class performance, please feel free to review the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ5VW.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

I wanted to share some feedback about Hannah\\u2019s progress in math class this week. Hannah was engaged and attentive during our lesson on line graphs, and she kept her camera on throughout the session, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nThis week, Hannah answered 12 in-class questions, getting 8 correct and missing 3 (questions #5, #6, and #9). She did not answer question #1, which may have been due to arriving late to class. Hannah missed 14 minutes of class time and had one disconnection during the session. Sometimes things come up, but I encourage you to help Hannah arrive on time and ensure her connection is stable so she doesn\\u2019t miss important parts of the lesson.\\n\\nOn the homework, Hannah scored an excellent 99%.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you are doing well. I wanted to share some feedback about Mike\\u2019s progress in math class this week. Mike was engaged and attentive during our lesson on line graphs, and he kept his camera on, which helped us stay connected throughout the session. He answered 10 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, showing a strong understanding of how to plot and interpret line graphs, as well as when to use them versus bar graphs. The two questions he did not answer were #1 and #9, which were at the beginning of class. Mike missed 8 minutes of class due to arriving late and had one brief disconnection, likely during the break. Sometimes things come up, but I encourage you to help Mike arrive on time whenever possible, as starting the lesson promptly helps him stay on track with the material.\\n\\nMike\\u2019s previous homework on subtraction of mixed numbers was completed with a perfect score of 100%, which is fantastic! I encourage him to continue reviewing the homework solution video to reinforce his learning.\\n\\nIf Mike would like extra practice, I recommend the supplemental problems in the workbook or additional problems upon request. Office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help, and recordings are available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. If needed, Mike is also welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can view Mike\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/voGMLV.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support!\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u987a\\u5229\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bMike\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002Mike\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u79ef\\u6781\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u4eec\\u80fd\\u591f\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u4e92\\u52a8\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u768410\\u9053\\uff0c\\u6b63\\u786e\\u7387\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\uff0c\\u8bf4\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u5bf9\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u800c\\u975e\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u6709\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7684\\u4e24\\u9053\\u9898\\u662f\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c9\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e24\\u9053\\u9898\\u51fa\\u73b0\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u59cb\\u9636\\u6bb5\\u3002Mike\\u56e0\\u8fdf\\u5230\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u4e868\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u6709\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u77ed\\u6682\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u53d1\\u751f\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u95f4\\u4f11\\u606f\\u65f6\\u3002\\u6709\\u65f6\\u96be\\u514d\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7a81\\u53d1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u5c3d\\u91cf\\u5e2e\\u52a9Mike\\u51c6\\u65f6\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6837\\u4ed6\\u80fd\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u8ddf\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\n\\nMike\\u4e0a\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4e86100%\\u7684\\u6ee1\\u5206\\uff0c\\u975e\\u5e38\\u68d2\\uff01\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u6240\\u5b66\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cMike\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6216\\u968f\\u65f6\\u5411\\u6211\\u7d22\\u53d6\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u540c\\u5b66\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0cMike\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u67e5\\u770bMike\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/voGMLV\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Emily,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding Peter\\u2019s absence from this week\\u2019s math class where we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I noticed we did not receive notice of his absence. I completely understand that things come up, especially with Thanksgiving just around the corner\\u2014holiday events or travel plans can make schedules tricky. If you would like, we can discuss options for rescheduling or transferring his class to ensure he stays caught up.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Peter did not complete the subtraction of mixed numbers assignment from last week. This topic is important as it builds foundational skills for working with fractions and borrowing from whole numbers. I encourage Peter to finish this assignment soon, and to aim for timely completion moving forward to support his progress.\\n\\nTo help Peter catch up and reinforce these concepts, we have extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. Also, our Tuesday 5 PM PDT office hours on the Think Student app are a great opportunity for homework or workbook help, and recordings of classes and office hours are available if he cannot attend live. If Peter would benefit from more personalized support, please remember we offer up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if I can assist with scheduling. I\\u2019m looking forward to seeing Peter back in class and helping him build confidence with these math skills.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Emily\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u8ddf\\u60a8\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\uff0c\\u5173\\u4e8ePeter\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8fd9\\u8282\\u8bfe\\u4e3b\\u8981\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4ec0\\u4e48\\u65f6\\u5019\\u9002\\u5408\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u6536\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u7f3a\\u8bfe\\u901a\\u77e5\\u3002\\u6211\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4e8b\\u60c5\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u4e34\\u65f6\\u53d1\\u751f\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u5230\\u4e86\\uff0c\\u5047\\u671f\\u6d3b\\u52a8\\u6216\\u65c5\\u884c\\u5b89\\u6392\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u4f1a\\u8ba9\\u65e5\\u7a0b\\u53d8\\u5f97\\u7d27\\u5f20\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u613f\\u610f\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u91cd\\u65b0\\u5b89\\u6392\\u6216\\u8c03\\u6362\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u7684\\u9009\\u9879\\uff0c\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u4ed6\\u80fd\\u8ddf\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cPeter\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u7684\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u5bf9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u5206\\u6570\\u501f\\u4f4d\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u975e\\u5e38\\u91cd\\u8981\\u3002\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1Peter\\u5c3d\\u5feb\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u9879\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u52aa\\u529b\\u5728\\u672a\\u6765\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u652f\\u6301\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u5e2e\\u52a9Peter\\u8865\\u4e0a\\u843d\\u4e0b\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u5e76\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9PDT\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4e0d\\u80fd\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u7684\\u540c\\u5b66\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u3002\\u5982\\u679cPeter\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u8bb0\\u5f97\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u5fd9\\u5b89\\u6392\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\u671f\\u5f85Peter\\u56de\\u5230\\u8bfe\\u5802\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u81ea\\u4fe1\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Maggie,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share how Arthur did in class this week as we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, using them to predict future values, and distinguishing when line graphs are preferable to bar graphs. Arthur was very engaged throughout the lessons, keeping his camera on and actively participating. He answered 12 in-class questions, getting 11 correct and only one incorrect (question #7). This strong performance reflects his solid understanding, though reviewing the concepts behind question #7 could help him master the material fully.\\n\\nArthur\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers, including borrowing from whole numbers when needed, earned him a perfect score of 100%. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to reinforce his approach and correct any small mistakes he might not have noticed.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Wei,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Karl's progress in this week's math class.\\n\\nKarl demonstrated excellent understanding of line graphs and their applications. During our in-class questions, he answered 11 out of 12 questions correctly, showing strong comprehension of plotting points, interpreting trends, and determining when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. His only stumble was on Question #12, which is a great opportunity for him to review that concept and strengthen his mastery.\\n\\nI also noticed that Karl was fully engaged throughout class, with his camera consistently on and his attention focused on the material. He missed about 6 minutes of class due to two brief disconnections, so I'd encourage you to troubleshoot any technical issues on your end. If problems persist, Think Academy's customer service team can help.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Karl scored 88% on last week's assignment on subtracting mixed numbers. That's a solid performance! I do recommend having him watch the homework solution video to review the problems he missed and understand where adjustments are needed.\\n\\nTo continue building on this momentum, Karl might benefit from working through the extra supplemental problems in the workbook. If he'd like additional practice beyond that, I'm happy to provide more problems upon request.

I understand that with Thanksgiving coming up, there may have been holiday events or travel plans.

Completing this homework is important to reinforce her skills, so I encourage Anna to finish it as soon as possible and aim to submit future assignments on time.\\n\\nTo help Anna catch up, she can access extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m also happy to provide additional practice problems if needed. Our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get homework and workbook help.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you and your family have a wonderful Thanksgiving! I'm writing to touch base about Kai's progress this week.\\n\\nI noticed that Kai was absent from our lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, as well as drawing trend lines and deciding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I understand that things come up, especially with holiday travel and family events around this time of year. However, I wanted to gently check in\\u2014if there are scheduling conflicts or if we need to arrange alternative class times to help Kai stay on track, please let me know. I'm here to work with you to find a solution that works best for your family.\\n\\nOn the homework front, I wanted to encourage Kai to complete last week's assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. Staying current with homework is really important for building strong foundational skills, and I'd love to see him catch up on this work. Moving forward, completing homework on time will help him feel more confident when we cover new material in class.\\n\\nSince Kai missed this week's lesson, I'd recommend reviewing the class recording when you have a chance\\u2014it's a great way to see what we covered. He can also take advantage of our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any questions about the homework or supplemental practice problems. If he needs extra support, I'd also encourage you to consider booking one of his free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nI'm excited to see Kai back in class next week. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u5173\\u95ed\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5e86\\u795d\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u548c\\u5bb6\\u4eba\\u6709\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u7f8e\\u597d\\u7684\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\uff01\\u6211\\u5199\\u8fd9\\u5c01\\u4fe1\\u662f\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5 Kai \\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230 Kai \\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u548c\\u51b3\\u5b9a\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4e8b\\u60c5\\u603b\\u4f1a\\u53d1\\u751f\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u5047\\u671f\\u65c5\\u884c\\u548c\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u6d3b\\u52a8\\u9891\\u7e41\\u7684\\u65f6\\u671f\\u3002\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u6e29\\u548c\\u5730\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u786e\\u8ba4\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u2014\\u2014\\u5982\\u679c\\u6709\\u65e5\\u7a0b\\u5b89\\u6392\\u51b2\\u7a81\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u6211\\u4eec\\u9700\\u8981\\u5b89\\u6392\\u66ff\\u4ee3\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u6765\\u5e2e\\u52a9 Kai \\u4fdd\\u6301\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u544a\\u8bc9\\u6211\\u3002\\u6211\\u5f88\\u4e50\\u610f\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5408\\u4f5c\\u627e\\u5230\\u6700\\u9002\\u5408\\u60a8\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u7684\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u65b9\\u6848\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u9f13\\u52b1 Kai \\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6280\\u80fd\\u975e\\u5e38\\u91cd\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5f88\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u770b\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u9879\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u3002\\u4eca\\u540e\\uff0c\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8bb2\\u6388\\u65b0\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u65f6\\u66f4\\u6709\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u7531\\u4e8e Kai \\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u6709\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u65f6\\u67e5\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e86\\u89e3\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6240\\u5b66\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u7684\\u597d\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5229\\u7528\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u6807\\u51c6\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u6765\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u7684\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u60a8\\u8003\\u8651\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u6211\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u770b\\u5230 Kai \\u56de\\u5230\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u7591\\u8651\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

I am pleased to share that Jessica has demonstrated strong engagement and attentiveness in class this week while learning about plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. She answered 11 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, with only question #10 answered incorrectly. This shows she is grasping the concepts very well, though reviewing that particular question could help solidify her understanding further.\\n\\nJessica\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators was completed with a perfect score of 100%, which reflects her solid skills in that area. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to reinforce the strategies, especially if she wants to review how to borrow from the whole number when subtracting fractions.\\n\\nTo support Jessica\\u2019s continued progress, she can benefit from extra practice problems available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional problems upon request.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some feedback on Evan's progress this week as we wrapped up our unit on line graphs.\\n\\nEvan demonstrated solid engagement in class and was attentive throughout our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and determining when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. On this week's in-class questions, he answered 12 total questions with 5 correct responses. However, I noticed he struggled with questions #6, #9, #11, and #12, and had difficulty with questions #2 and #3 as well. He also didn't attempt question #8. These areas suggest he may benefit from reviewing the concepts we covered, particularly around some of the more complex applications.\\n\\nOn the homework side, Evan scored 92% on his mixed number subtraction assignment\\u2014excellent work! I'd encourage him to watch the homework solution video to review the few problems he missed so he can strengthen his understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Evan's continued growth, I'd recommend he work through the supplemental problems in the workbook, which reinforce these graphing concepts. He's also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for additional help. If he'd benefit from more personalized support, Evan qualifies for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester\\u2014you can book one here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find a detailed breakdown of this week's in-class performance here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5aKZ\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in Evan's learning!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u5230 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u5ea6\\u8fc7\\u6109\\u5feb\\u7684\\u65f6\\u5149\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab Evan \\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u53cd\\u9988\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u521a\\u521a\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e86\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u5355\\u5143\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\nEvan \\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u786e\\u5b9a\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u3002\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86 12 \\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d 5 \\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c 6\\u30019\\u300111 \\u548c 12 \\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u7b2c 2 \\u548c 3 \\u9898\\u4e5f\\u6709\\u4e9b\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u8fd8\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7b2c 8 \\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u590d\\u4e60\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6240\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u7684\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u7279\\u522b\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u66f4\\u590d\\u6742\\u7684\\u5e94\\u7528\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cEvan \\u7684\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a 92%\\u2014\\u2014\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u8272\\uff01\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u65b9\\u6848\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4ed6\\u9057\\u6f0f\\u7684\\u51e0\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u4fbf\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u524d\\u8fdb\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Evan \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5f3a\\u5316\\u4ed6\\u5bf9\\u56fe\\u8868\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4ee5\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c Evan \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u2014\\u2014\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u9884\\u8ba2\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u67e5\\u770b\\u672c\\u5468\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u5206\\u6790\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5aKZ\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u5728 Evan \\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5408\\u4f5c\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Yan,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Jessie has shown strong engagement in class this week, keeping her camera on and staying attentive throughout our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Her participation is commendable.  \\n\\nJessie answered 12 in-class questions, getting 8 correct, 3 incorrect (questions #7, #10, and #12), and leaving question #9 unanswered. These specific questions may indicate areas where she could benefit from a bit more review and practice to solidify her understanding. Encouraging Jessie to revisit those questions and concepts at home could be quite helpful.  \\n\\nHer recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators scored 92%, which is excellent. I recommend that she watches the homework solution video to review any mistakes and deepen her grasp of borrowing from the whole number when needed.  \\n\\nFor additional support, Jessie can work on extra problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide more practice problems upon request. Please remind her that office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework and workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if she can\\u2019t attend live.  \\n\\nIf you feel Jessie would benefit from more personalized attention, we offer up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can easily book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXqEp.  \\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if I can assist further.  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Yan\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002Jessie \\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u5f88\\u5f3a\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u5979\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u4e8e\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u3002\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u975e\\u5e38\\u503c\\u5f97\\u8868\\u626c\\u3002  \\n\\nJessie \\u672c\\u5468\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d8\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c3\\u9053\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u7b2c7\\u9898\\u3001\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u67091\\u9898\\uff08\\u7b2c9\\u9898\\uff09\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u5177\\u4f53\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53cd\\u6620\\u4e86\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u66f4\\u591a\\u590d\\u4e60\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u6765\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u7684\\u90e8\\u5206\\u3002\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u56de\\u987e\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u95ee\\u9898\\u53ca\\u76f8\\u5173\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5979\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a92%\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4f18\\u5f02\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u6790\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u590d\\u4e60\\u9519\\u8bef\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u5bf9\\u5728\\u5206\\u6570\\u90e8\\u5206\\u4e0d\\u591f\\u65f6\\u4ece\\u6574\\u6570\\u90e8\\u5206\\u501f\\u4f4d\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u591a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0cJessie \\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u8bfe\\u540e\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u82e5\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u5979\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u518c\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u4e0d\\u80fd\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u5236\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u968f\\u65f6\\u56de\\u770b\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97 Jessie \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXqEp\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u7591\\u95ee\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u8bda\\u631a\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Austin\\u2019s progress this week in math. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines for predictions, and distinguishing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Austin was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson and consistently kept his camera on, which was wonderful to see.\\n\\nAustin answered 12 in-class questions, correctly solving 7 of them. He struggled particularly with questions #6, #7, and #11, and didn\\u2019t answer #1 and #3. These indicate some concepts may need more reinforcement, especially around interpreting and using line graphs. I encourage you to review these questions with him to better understand where he might be feeling unsure.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Austin scored 68% on the subtraction of mixed numbers, including borrowing when needed. Watching the homework solution video and correcting his mistakes could significantly boost his understanding and confidence.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you are doing well. I wanted to share some feedback about Sophia\\u2019s progress in math class this week. She was engaged and attentive during our lessons, and I appreciate that she kept her camera on throughout class. Her participation was positive and she contributed well to our discussions.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, how to draw trend lines, and when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Sophia answered 12 questions in class, getting 8 correct, 3 incorrect, and leaving 1 unanswered. The questions she missed were #4, #6, and #9, and she did not answer #10. I encourage her to review these questions using the in-class report, which you can find here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JOwojq. This will help her better understand where she might need extra practice.\\n\\nHer most recent homework score was 63%. I recommend that Sophia watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes to reinforce her understanding. If she needs more practice, she can work on the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, or I can provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nFor extra support, Sophia is welcome to join our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if she cannot attend live. If she would like more personalized help, she is eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Peggie,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to check in regarding Charlotte\\u2019s attendance for this week\\u2019s lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, and drawing trend lines. Charlotte was absent, and I didn\\u2019t receive prior notice. I completely understand that things come up, especially with Thanksgiving just around the corner\\u2014holiday events and travel plans can certainly disrupt schedules. If you need assistance rescheduling or transferring her class time to better fit your plans, please don\\u2019t hesitate to let me know. We\\u2019re happy to support in any way we can.\\n\\nRegarding her homework on subtraction of mixed numbers, Charlotte scored 73%. I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video to review where she might have made mistakes and to help strengthen her understanding. Additional supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I can provide more practice problems upon request. Also, Charlotte can attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for extra help with homework or workbook questions. All class and office hour recordings are accessible if she can\\u2019t attend live sessions.\\n\\nIf you feel Charlotte would benefit from more personalized support, remember that she has access to up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if I can assist in helping Charlotte catch up.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Yanping,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well! I wanted to share some wonderful feedback about Jocelyn's performance this week in our line graphs unit.\\n\\nJocelyn demonstrated exceptional understanding of the material we covered. During our in-class questions, she answered 11 out of 12 questions correctly, with only Question #3 requiring some additional refinement. Her engagement throughout the 90-minute session was outstanding\\u2014she kept her camera on, remained attentive, and actively participated in our discussions. This kind of consistent engagement is exactly what helps students truly master mathematical concepts.\\n\\nI did notice one brief technical disconnection during class, which may have occurred during our break. If you experience any ongoing connectivity issues, our Think customer service team is available to help troubleshoot.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Jocelyn scored 62% on the mixed number subtraction assignment. I'd like to encourage her to review the homework solution video and work through the problems she missed. This will help solidify her understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Jocelyn's continued growth, I'd like to suggest a few resources.

Clark has been actively engaged in class this week, demonstrating good attentiveness and keeping his camera on throughout the lesson. He participated by answering 12 in-class questions, correctly solving 7 of them, with 1 partially correct, 3 incorrect (questions 7, 10, and 11), and 1 left unanswered (question 8). These particular questions might be useful points to review with him to strengthen his understanding.\\n\\nClark\\u2019s attendance was nearly complete, though he missed 2 minutes of class and experienced one brief disconnection, possibly during the break. To support uninterrupted learning, please ensure his connection is stable, and feel free to reach out to Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Clark scored an excellent 96% on subtraction of mixed numbers, which shows strong grasp of the concepts. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to review any minor errors he made and reinforce his skills.\\n\\nTo support Clark\\u2019s progress, supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice if needed.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some observations about Maggie's performance in this week's math class on line graphs and trend analysis.\\n\\nMaggie was fully engaged throughout the lesson, with her camera on and her attention focused on the material. She answered 9 in-class questions total, getting 4 correct. However, she struggled with questions #6, #7, and #8, and didn't provide answers to questions #3 and #5. These particular questions required deeper application of the concepts we covered, so this tells me Maggie may benefit from extra practice with the more complex aspects of line graph interpretation and prediction.\\n\\nI do want to address her homework from last week: Maggie did not complete the assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I'd like to encourage her to go back and complete this work, as it's foundational for the concepts we're building on. Moving forward, completing homework on time will really help her solidify these skills and build confidence.\\n\\nHere's what I recommend: Maggie could work through the extra supplemental problems in the workbook to strengthen her understanding of line graphs. She's also welcome to join office hours next Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app if she'd like to discuss any of these concepts further. If she needs more personalized support, she can book one of her free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions at https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u2014I think this could really help her work through those trickier application questions.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JwoeLA\\n\\nLooking forward to seeing Maggie back next week!\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u5230 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u5ea6\\u8fc7\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u7f8e\\u597d\\u7684\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u5173\\u4e8e Maggie \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff08\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u5206\\u6790\\uff09\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u89c2\\u5bdf\\u3002\\n\\nMaggie \\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u90fd\\u5f88\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u4e0a\\u3002\\u5979\\u603b\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86 9 \\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d 4 \\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4f46\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c #6\\u3001#7 \\u548c #8 \\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7b2c #3 \\u548c #5 \\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u7279\\u5b9a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u6df1\\u5c42\\u6b21\\u5730\\u5e94\\u7528\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6240\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u7684\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u544a\\u8bc9\\u6211 Maggie \\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u5728\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u548c\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u7684\\u66f4\\u590d\\u6742\\u65b9\\u9762\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u786e\\u5b9e\\u60f3\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u5979\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff1aMaggie \\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u56de\\u8fc7\\u5934\\u6765\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u9879\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6240\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u57fa\\u7840\\u3002\\u5c55\\u671b\\u672a\\u6765\\uff0c\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u771f\\u6b63\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u5e76\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u6211\\u7684\\u5efa\\u8bae\\uff1aMaggie \\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6765\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u5bf9\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u60f3\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u5979\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u52a0\\u5165 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u5979\\u7684\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e4b\\u4e00\\uff0c\\u5730\\u5740\\u4e3a https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u2014\\u2014\\u6211\\u8ba4\\u4e3a\\u8fd9\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u771f\\u7684\\u80fd\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u90a3\\u4e9b\\u66f4\\u590d\\u6742\\u7684\\u5e94\\u7528\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JwoeLA\\n\\n\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u89c1\\u5230 Maggie\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

I want to share some feedback on John\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. John participated actively and kept his camera on throughout the class, showing attentiveness and engagement, which is wonderful to see.  \\n\\nJohn answered 19 questions during class, with 11 correct and 6 incorrect responses. He struggled particularly with questions #2, #6, #10, #15, #16, and #18, and left questions #1 and #19 unanswered. These indicate areas where he might benefit from additional practice or clarification. I recommend reviewing these specific questions with him to strengthen his understanding.  \\n\\nHe missed about 2 minutes of class due to a brief disconnection, possibly during the break. Ensuring uninterrupted attendance will help him stay fully connected with the material. If technical issues arise, please feel free to contact Think Academy customer service for support.  \\n\\nJohn\\u2019s recent homework on subtraction of mixed numbers scored 86%, which is solid. Please encourage him to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes he made to deepen his learning. For extra practice, he can use the supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional problems from me anytime.  \\n\\nTo support John further, I invite him to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework or workbook questions.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share an update on Hamsika\\u2019s progress this week. She has been very engaged and attentive in class, consistently keeping her camera on, which I appreciate as it helps maintain focus. During our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and distinguishing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs, Hamsika answered 12 questions, getting 11 correct and only missing one \\u2014 specifically question #4. This shows she has a strong grasp of the material overall, with just a small area to review.\\n\\nHer homework on subtracting mixed numbers was completed with a perfect score of 100%, which is excellent. I encourage you to have Hamsika watch the homework solution video again to reinforce her understanding and ensure she feels confident with any tricky parts.\\n\\nTo support her continued growth, Hamsika can practice additional problems in the workbook, and if she would like more challenges or clarification, I\\u2019m happy to provide extra problems upon request. Please remind her that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework and workbook questions. For more personalized assistance, remember that up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can also review Hamsika\\u2019s detailed performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JPaAK1.\\n\\nThank you for your support, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further resources.\\n\\nBest regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u54c8\\u59c6\\u897f\\u5361\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u5f88\\u6b23\\u8d4f\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u3002\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u54c8\\u59c6\\u897f\\u5361\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d11\\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u4ec5\\u9519\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u9898\\u2014\\u2014\\u7b2c4\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u638c\\u63e1\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u597d\\uff0c\\u53ea\\u6709\\u5c11\\u8bb8\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u9700\\u8981\\u590d\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u6ee1\\u5206100%\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u51fa\\u8272\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u54c8\\u59c6\\u897f\\u5361\\u518d\\u6b21\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u96be\\u70b9\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6709\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u54c8\\u59c6\\u897f\\u5361\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u4e66\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u6216\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192\\u5979\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u4e66\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u9700\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u514d\\u8d39\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u54c8\\u59c6\\u897f\\u5361\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JPaAK1\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\n\\u656c\\u793c  \\n\\u5965\\u9a6c\\u5c14\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Shenjian,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Eric has been demonstrating great focus and participation in our recent lessons on line graphs. He answered 11 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, showing strong understanding and engagement. The one question he missed was question #12, which we can review together to ensure he fully grasps the concept. Eric kept his camera on consistently and remained attentive throughout class, which positively supports his learning.\\n\\nThis week we covered how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines, and decide when line graphs are more appropriate than bar graphs. Eric is making excellent progress with these skills. For homework, he worked on subtracting mixed numbers and scored 77%. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes, as this practice will strengthen his confidence and accuracy moving forward.\\n\\nTo support Eric further, please remind him that extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice if needed. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for homework help, and recordings are available if he can\\u2019t attend live. Also, remember that Eric can use up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Eric\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vXMAO7.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Jieying,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Luna's performance in this week's math class.\\n\\nLuna demonstrated excellent engagement throughout our lesson on line graphs. She was attentive, kept her camera on, and participated actively in our discussion about plotting, interpreting line graphs, and determining when line graphs are most useful compared to bar graphs. Out of 12 in-class questions, Luna answered 10 correctly, which shows strong understanding of the material. She did miss Question #1 and had difficulty with Question #10, but these are great opportunities for targeted review.\\n\\nI do want to address one concern: Luna did not complete last week's homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I'd like to encourage her to finish this assignment, as practicing these foundational skills is important before moving forward. Going forward, completing homework on time will help reinforce what we cover in class and build her confidence with new topics.\\n\\nTo support Luna's continued progress, I'd like to suggest a few resources. Our supplemental workbook contains extra practice problems that could help strengthen her skills. Additionally, our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT are a great opportunity for homework help. If Luna would benefit from more personalized support, she's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester\\u2014you can book one here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find a detailed report of this week's performance here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/R5QqdO\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Luna's learning!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u6d01\\u82f1\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab\\u5173\\u4e8eLuna\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nLuna\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u6781\\u5f3a\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5979\\u8ba4\\u771f\\u542c\\u8bb2\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u542f\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u4e86\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u786e\\u5b9a\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u800c\\u975e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u3002\\u572812\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\uff0cLuna\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e8610\\u9053\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u6240\\u5b66\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u6709\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff0c\\u7b2c10\\u9898\\u6709\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u90fd\\u662f\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u6027\\u590d\\u4e60\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u786e\\u5b9e\\u60f3\\u63d0\\u51fa\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff1aLuna\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u9879\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6280\\u80fd\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u65b0\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u5f88\\u91cd\\u8981\\u3002\\u4eca\\u540e\\uff0c\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9Luna\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u6240\\u5b66\\u5185\\u5bb9\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u65b0\\u4e3b\\u9898\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301Luna\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u51e0\\u9879\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u5305\\u542b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u5979\\u7684\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u7684\\u597d\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\u5982\\u679cLuna\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u2014\\u2014\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u9884\\u8ba2\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u67e5\\u770b\\u672c\\u5468\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/R5QqdO\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u4f60\\u5728\\u652f\\u6301Luna\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u65b9\\u9762\\u7684\\u5408\\u4f5c\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u795d\\u798f\\uff0c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Haorui participated actively and attentively in this week\\u2019s class on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. He kept his camera on consistently, showing good engagement throughout the lesson. However, Haorui missed 10 minutes of class by leaving early, which likely contributed to the unanswered questions (#8, #9, #10, #11, #12). I understand that sometimes unexpected things come up, but I encourage you to help ensure he stays for the full class time to maximize learning.\\n\\nDuring the lesson, Haorui answered 12 questions: he got 4 correct, 1 partially correct (#3), and 2 incorrect (#6 and #7). These specific questions indicate areas where he could benefit from further practice. Additionally, he experienced one disconnection, possibly during the break; please check his tech setup to help avoid interruptions. If needed, Think customer service can assist with technical issues.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Haorui scored 33% on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Thidar,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share an update on Shane\\u2019s progress in our recent class on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict values, and distinguishing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Shane attended 81 minutes of the 90-minute lesson, arriving a bit late and experiencing two disconnections, which may have affected his ability to answer some early questions (specifically #1, #3, and #5) that he left unanswered. If possible, encouraging him to join class on time and ensuring stable connectivity could help him engage fully throughout the session.\\n\\nDuring class, Shane answered 9 questions: he answered 1 correctly, 1 partially correctly (#2), and had 4 incorrect responses (#4, #6, #7, #8). While he was engaged and kept his camera on, these results suggest he is still developing confidence with this material. For reinforcement, I recommend he review the extra supplemental problems in the workbook and watch the homework solution video related to subtraction of mixed numbers, where he scored 85%. Correcting mistakes from the homework will further support his understanding.\\n\\nPlease remind Shane that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for additional help, and class recordings are accessible if he misses any part of the live session. If you feel Shane would benefit from more personalized support, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester are available; you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Shane\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jp5PB7.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Nadia,\\n\\nI hope you and your family are enjoying the holiday season. I wanted to share some feedback about Olivia\\u2019s progress in math class this week.\\n\\nOlivia was absent from our lesson this week, which covered how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines, and understand when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. I know things can come up, especially with Thanksgiving just around the corner, so I completely understand if there were family events or travel plans. If you\\u2019d like to discuss rescheduling or transferring class times, please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Olivia scored 50% on the assignment covering subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I encourage Olivia to watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes, as this will help reinforce the concepts and improve her understanding. If she needs extra practice, I recommend working through the supplemental problems in the workbook, or I can provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nFor extra support, Olivia is welcome to join our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework and workbook questions. Recordings of all classes and office hours are also available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. If she would benefit from more individualized attention, she is eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there\\u2019s anything else I can do to support Olivia\\u2019s learning.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u81f311\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u4e0b\\u4e00\\u5468\\u5c06\\u6062\\u590d\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u3002\\u795d\\u5927\\u5bb6\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Nadia\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u548c\\u60a8\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u4eba\\u6b63\\u5728\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u8282\\u65e5\\u5b63\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bOlivia\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\n\\nOlivia\\u672c\\u5468\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8282\\u8bfe\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u51fa\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u800c\\u4e0d\\u662f\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u3002\\u6211\\u77e5\\u9053\\u751f\\u6d3b\\u4e2d\\u96be\\u514d\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7a81\\u53d1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u5c24\\u5176\\u662f\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4e34\\u8fd1\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u6709\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u6d3b\\u52a8\\u6216\\u65c5\\u884c\\u5b89\\u6392\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u8c03\\u6574\\u6216\\u66f4\\u6362\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cOlivia\\u5728\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff08\\u5305\\u62ec\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\uff09\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u4e8650\\u5206\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8baeOlivia\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u8ba2\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\u5e76\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u6211\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0cOlivia\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u53d6\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u95ee\\u9898\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u6240\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u4e5f\\u90fd\\u4f1a\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u7ed9\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u5b66\\u751f\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u3002\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u6211\\u4e3aOlivia\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u5176\\u4ed6\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u544a\\u8bc9\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

We covered how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines to predict future values, and when it\\u2019s appropriate to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Melissa answered 12 questions during class, with 8 correct, 1 partially correct (question #3), 2 incorrect (#7 and #11), and 1 unanswered (#1). She was attentive with her camera on but seemed somewhat distracted at times. Melissa missed about 3 minutes of class due to a brief disconnection\\u2014please ensure her attendance is continuous, and feel free to contact Think customer service for any tech support needed.\\n\\nMelissa\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers scored only 4% because she did not answer 11 out of 13 questions. I encourage Melissa to watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes. To support her, she can also use extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems. I am happy to offer help during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where she can ask questions about homework or workbook problems. Recordings are available if she cannot attend live.\\n\\nIf Melissa would benefit from more personalized support, please consider booking one of the up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Melissa\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JeZgbA.\\n\\nThank you for your support.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Xue,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some feedback on Roger's performance in this week's math class on graphing and data interpretation.\\n\\nRoger demonstrated strong engagement throughout the lesson\\u2014he kept his camera on and remained attentive as we worked through plotting line graphs, finding trend lines, and determining when to use different graph types. His participation was valuable to the class.\\n\\nOn the in-class questions, Roger answered 9 total questions with 4 correct responses. He had one partially correct answer on Question #3 and one incorrect response on Question #4. I noticed he didn't provide answers to Questions #1, #5, and #7. I want to mention that Roger left class about a minute early this week. Sometimes things come up, and I understand that\\u2014but I'd gently encourage you to help ensure he stays until the end of class when possible, as the final questions often reinforce key concepts.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Roger scored 88% on the mixed number subtraction assignment, which is solid work!

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Jinyu,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to reach out with some positive feedback about Grace's performance in this week's math class.\\n\\nGrace demonstrated excellent engagement and focus throughout our lesson on line graphs. She answered 10 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, which shows strong understanding of plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and applying them to make predictions. She had a bit of difficulty with Question #12 and didn't respond to Question #1, but these represent small areas where she might benefit from a quick review.\\n\\nI also wanted to mention that Grace's homework score this week was 85% on the subtraction of mixed numbers problems. While this is a solid score, I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution video and work through her mistakes. This will help reinforce the borrowing process when the fraction part isn't large enough to subtract.\\n\\nTo support Grace's continued growth, I have a few suggestions. She could work through the extra supplemental problems in the workbook for additional practice with line graphs.

Andrew has shown great engagement during this week\\u2019s lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, as well as using trend lines for predictions. He participated actively and kept his camera on throughout the class, which is wonderful to see. Andrew answered 9 questions in class, with 6 correct, 1 partially correct (question #3), and 2 incorrect (questions #8 and #9). These last two questions indicate some areas where he could benefit from additional practice to solidify his understanding.\\n\\nHis attention and participation remain strong, though he did miss about 1 minute due to a brief disconnection. To ensure he doesn\\u2019t miss important content, please help him troubleshoot any technical issues or contact Think customer service if needed for support.\\n\\nAndrew\\u2019s homework on subtraction of mixed numbers was completed with a perfect score of 100%. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to reinforce his skills and self-correct if needed. For extra support, there are supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I can provide additional practice upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Andrew that office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great opportunity for homework and workbook help. Also, up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available to deepen his understanding if he feels it would be helpful.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Sara,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Johnson\\u2019s progress in class this week. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nJohnson attended almost the entire lesson, missing just 4 minutes and had two brief disconnections, one possibly during the break. To support his continuous engagement, please ensure his tech connection is stable; Think customer service is available if you need assistance troubleshooting.\\n\\nIn class, Johnson answered 12 questions: he got 3 correct, 3 partially correct, 5 incorrect, and left 1 unanswered. He particularly struggled with questions #4, #7, #9, #11, and #12. These specific challenges suggest he could benefit from additional practice and review of the lesson concepts.\\n\\nHis homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators was strong, scoring 92%. I recommend that Johnson watch the homework solution video to review any errors and solidify his understanding.\\n\\nTo help him improve, extra problems are available in the workbook, and I encourage you to have him try those. Additionally, office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for extra support. If you feel Johnson would benefit from more personalized help, please consider booking one of his three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about his in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yo0L8.\\n\\nThank you for your support in helping Johnson grow his math skills.

She actively engaged throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on and showing good attention. However, Elizabeth missed about 8 minutes of class due to a late arrival and experienced one disconnection, which may have affected her ability to answer some early questions (#1, #2, #3, #8, #9). I understand things can come up, but if possible, helping Elizabeth attend class on time and troubleshooting any connection issues would be very beneficial.\\n\\nDuring this week\\u2019s lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Elizabeth answered 12 questions in class but correctly solved only 3. She struggled particularly with questions #4, #6, #7, and #10. This suggests she may need some extra practice to build confidence with these concepts. Additionally, her recent homework on subtraction of mixed numbers scored 23%.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Hua,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some feedback about Alina's performance in this week's math class on graphing and data interpretation.\\n\\nAlina was fully engaged throughout the lesson\\u2014her camera was consistently on and she remained attentive the entire time, which I really appreciate. During our in-class questions, she answered 6 out of 12 correctly and had one partially correct response. However, I noticed she struggled with questions #7, #9, #10, and #12, and didn't attempt question #1. These are areas where we'll want to focus some additional practice.\\n\\nOn the homework side, Alina scored 64% on the mixed number subtraction assignment. I'd like to encourage her to watch the homework solution video and work through the problems she missed\\u2014this will help her solidify her understanding of borrowing from whole numbers and working with unlike denominators.\\n\\nHere's what I recommend to help Alina build confidence and mastery:\\n\\n- Watch the homework solution video and correct the mistakes from this week's assignment\\n- Work through the extra supplemental problems available in the workbook to reinforce the graphing concepts\\n- Attend office hours next Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for additional support\\n- Consider booking a free 1-on-1 tutoring session: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about her in-class performance in the attached report link.\\n\\nI'm confident that with a bit of focused practice, Alina will strengthen these skills.

In our recent lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, Samara answered 12 questions in class with 9 correct, 1 partially correct (question #1), 1 incorrect (question #7), and 1 unanswered (question #11). These specific questions indicate some areas where she can benefit from additional practice to strengthen her understanding.\\n\\nRegarding her homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, Samara scored 73%. To help her improve, I recommend she watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes she made. This review can reinforce her skills and boost her confidence.\\n\\nPlease remind Samara that extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice if needed. Also, office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for real-time help.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share an update on Dena\\u2019s progress in class this week. She has shown great engagement and attentiveness during our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, as well as drawing trend lines and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Dena kept her camera on consistently, which helped maintain her focus.\\n\\nIn terms of in-class questions, Dena answered 12 questions, with 7 correct, 2 partially correct, and 3 incorrect. Specifically, she struggled with questions #4, #10, and #11, and had partial success on #2 and #8. These questions indicate areas where she could benefit from additional practice and review.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtraction of mixed numbers, Dena scored 45%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and carefully correct any errors she made to improve her understanding. To support her growth, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Dena that office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, which can be very helpful for homework and workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if she cannot attend live. Additionally, she has access to up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about her in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/94xq7r. I\\u2019m confident with continued practice and support, Dena will strengthen her skills and do well in upcoming lessons.\\n\\nThank you for your support, and please feel free to reach out with any questions.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bDena\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u65f6\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5ea6\\u548c\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5979\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e5f\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e86\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u73af\\u8282\\uff0cDena\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d7\\u9898\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c2\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c3\\u9898\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c4\\u300110\\u548c11\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u7b2c2\\u548c8\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53cd\\u6620\\u4e86\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u548c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u7684\\u90e8\\u5206\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cDena\\u7684\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a45%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u8ba4\\u771f\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u652f\\u6301\\u5979\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u4e86\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192Dena\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u975e\\u5e38\\u9002\\u5408\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u7b54\\u7591\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u89c2\\u770b\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u7684\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u4e3a\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5979\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/94xq7r\\u3002\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u548c\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0cDena\\u4f1a\\u5728\\u63a5\\u4e0b\\u6765\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u597d\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Kelly,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to reach out with some feedback on Ryan's performance in this week's math lesson on line graphs.\\n\\nRyan was fully engaged throughout class\\u2014his camera was consistently on and he was attentive the entire time, which I really appreciate. He answered 12 in-class questions, getting 5 completely correct. However, I noticed he struggled with questions #7, #9, #10, #11, and #12, and had partial understanding on questions #3 and #8. These are important concepts for mastering how to plot, interpret, and use line graphs effectively.\\n\\nI also want to mention that Ryan did not complete last week's homework on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I'd like to encourage him to go back and complete that assignment, as it covers foundational skills that will support his progress in upcoming lessons. Moving forward, completing homework on time will help reinforce what he learns in class and identify any gaps early.\\n\\nTo help Ryan build confidence with these concepts, I recommend he work through the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, which provides additional practice beyond the textbook. He's also welcome to request more problems if he'd like extra practice. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great resource for homework and workbook help. Additionally, Ryan has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which could be particularly helpful for diving deeper into line graph concepts: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ5LW\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u800c\\u5173\\u95ed\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 Kelly\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5173\\u4e8e Ryan \\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u7ebf\\u6027\\u56fe\\u8868\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nRyan \\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6295\\u5165\\u2014\\u2014\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5904\\u4e8e\\u6253\\u5f00\\u72b6\\u6001\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u6211\\u975e\\u5e38\\u611f\\u8c22\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u70b9\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86 12 \\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d 5 \\u9053\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4f46\\u662f\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c #7\\u3001#9\\u3001#10\\u3001#11 \\u548c #12 \\u9898\\u4e2d\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u5728\\u7b2c #3 \\u548c #8 \\u9898\\u4e2d\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4e0d\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u90fd\\u662f\\u638c\\u63e1\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u3001\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u548c\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u7ebf\\u6027\\u56fe\\u8868\\u7684\\u91cd\\u8981\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u8fd8\\u60f3\\u63d0\\u5230 Ryan \\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u8fc7\\u5934\\u6765\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u90a3\\u9879\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u5b83\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u4e86\\u5c06\\u652f\\u6301\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u5373\\u5c06\\u5230\\u6765\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u7684\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\u4eca\\u540e\\uff0c\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5b66\\u5230\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5c3d\\u65e9\\u53d1\\u73b0\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u7a7a\\u767d\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u5e2e\\u52a9 Ryan \\u589e\\u5f3a\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u95ee\\u9898\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u4e86\\u8d85\\u51fa\\u6559\\u79d1\\u4e66\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u60f3\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8981\\u6c42\\u66f4\\u591a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u7684\\u7edd\\u4f73\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0cRyan \\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u6df1\\u5165\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7ebf\\u6027\\u56fe\\u8868\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7279\\u522b\\u6709\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ5LW\\n\\n\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u544a\\u8bc9\\u6211\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6700\\u597d\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

He answered 12 in-class questions, with 8 correct, 1 partially correct, and 3 incorrect responses.

He missed 5 minutes of class and experienced three brief disconnections\\u2014one possibly during the break. To support continuous learning, please ensure he has a stable connection, and feel free to reach out to Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nHis recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers was scored at 92%, which is excellent. I encourage you to have Christian watch the homework solution video to review any errors and solidify his understanding.\\n\\nTo further support Christian, extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional practice problems upon request.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:\\nDear Roberta,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share how Ryan is progressing in class this week as we explored plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Ryan demonstrated strong engagement throughout the lessons, keeping his camera on and staying attentive, which positively impacted his performance.\\n\\nOut of 22 in-class questions, Ryan answered 19 correctly, with one partially correct response on question #1, one incorrect on question #10, and one unanswered question (#22). These few questions offer great opportunities for review to solidify his understanding. His homework on subtracting mixed numbers was excellent, with a perfect score of 100%, showing strong skills in that area.\\n\\nTo support Ryan further, I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to reinforce his learning and correct any small errors. Additionally, supplemental problems are available in the workbook if he wishes to practice more, and I am happy to provide extra problems upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Ryan about the Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can ask questions about homework or workbook problems. Also, if you feel Ryan could benefit from more personalized support, you can book up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Ryan\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://student-h5.thethinkacademy.com/learningReport?studentId=8247494&classId=87975&planId=462505&schoolCode=415&report_log_id=-1&skey=0d02e173bd4736616632f6d3562df298.1764211153747\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Cindy,\\n\\nI want to share an update on Kingston\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math lesson. He did very well overall, answering 11 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, with only question #9 left unanswered. Kingston was engaged and attentive throughout the class, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on consistently. He missed just 1 minute of class due to a brief disconnection, possibly during the break. To help ensure he doesn\\u2019t miss content, please check his tech setup, and if needed, Think customer service can assist with any issues.\\n\\nThis week\\u2019s lesson focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Kingston showed strong understanding in these areas based on his in-class answers.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, Kingston scored 85%. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes, as this will reinforce his skills. For extra practice, he can try supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional ones.  \\n\\nRemember, office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app if Kingston would like help with homework or workbook questions. Additionally, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions are available each semester and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Kingston\\u2019s in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/J31q7z.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Olivia,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Jasper\\u2019s progress in math this week. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and deciding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nJasper was engaged and attentive throughout the lessons, with his camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see. In-class, he answered 12 questions but had difficulty with questions #3, #9, and #10, and did not answer #1, #2, #7, and #11. These areas could benefit from some additional review to build confidence and accuracy.\\n\\nFor homework, Jasper scored 85% on subtracting mixed numbers, including borrowing from the whole number when needed. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to understand any mistakes and solidify his skills there.\\n\\nTo support Jasper further, he can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems if needed. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT are also a great opportunity for him to get help on homework or workbook questions. If you feel Jasper would benefit from more personalized support, please consider booking one of his up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Jasper\\u2019s performance in this week\\u2019s in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/R2WqOV.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support at home.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Mandi,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to reach out with some positive feedback about Damon's performance in this week's math class on graphing and data interpretation.\\n\\nDamon demonstrated strong engagement throughout our lesson. He was attentive, kept his camera on, and participated actively in our in-class questions. Out of 12 questions, he answered 7 correctly and 3 partially correctly\\u2014a solid performance that shows he's grasping the core concepts we covered this week. I did notice he found questions #2, #3, #8, and #9 more challenging, which tells me there are some specific areas where he could benefit from extra practice and review.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Damon scored 87% on his mixed number subtraction assignment. That's a respectable score! I'd encourage him to watch the homework solution video and work through the problems he missed. This will help reinforce his understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Damon's continued growth, I have a few recommendations. He could benefit from working through the extra supplemental problems in the workbook to build confidence with these concepts. Additionally, our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great resource for homework and workbook help. If he'd like more personalized support, Damon is eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester\\u2014you can book one here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97Mqn1\\n\\nKeep up the great work, Damon! I look forward to seeing you next week.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\uff09\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 Mandi\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab Damon \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\uff08\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u56fe\\u8868\\u548c\\u6570\\u636e\\u89e3\\u91ca\\uff09\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nDamon \\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5f88\\u5f3a\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u4e86\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u3002\\u5728 12 \\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e86 7 \\u4e2a\\uff0c\\u90e8\\u5206\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e86 3 \\u4e2a\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff0c\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u6b63\\u5728\\u638c\\u63e1\\u6211\\u4eec\\u672c\\u5468\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u7684\\u6838\\u5fc3\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u3002\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c #2\\u3001#3\\u3001#8 \\u548c #9 \\u9898\\u4e2d\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u66f4\\u591a\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u67d0\\u4e9b\\u7279\\u5b9a\\u9886\\u57df\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4ece\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u548c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u53d7\\u76ca\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cDamon \\u5728\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u5206 87%\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u4e0d\\u9519\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u65b9\\u6848\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4ed6\\u505a\\u9519\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u524d\\u8fdb\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Damon \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6709\\u51e0\\u9879\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6765\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u7684\\u7edd\\u4f73\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u60f3\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0cDamon \\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u8d44\\u683c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u2014\\u2014\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u9884\\u8ba2\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/97Mqn1\\n\\n\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u52a0\\u6cb9\\uff0cDamon\\uff01\\u6211\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u89c1\\u5230\\u4f60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Abhay,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Vivaan has shown great engagement and attentiveness in class this week, consistently keeping his camera on and actively participating. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Vivaan answered 12 questions during class, with 8 correct answers, 1 partially correct, and 3 incorrect responses on questions #6, #11, and #12. The partially correct question was #1. These specific questions indicate areas where further practice could be beneficial.\\n\\nFor homework, Vivaan earned a solid score of 92% on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from whole numbers when needed. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video to review any mistakes and deepen his understanding.  \\n\\nTo support Vivaan\\u2019s continued growth, I recommend he practice additional problems from the workbook, especially related to the lesson topics. He is welcome to request extra problems if he wishes, and I am available during office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app to assist with homework or workbook questions. Also, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester are available, and you can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find a detailed breakdown of Vivaan\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RNlAb4.

This week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Chelsea was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and I appreciate that she kept her camera on, which helps us stay connected.\\n\\nIn class, Chelsea answered 12 questions, getting 8 correct, 1 partially correct, and 3 incorrect. She struggled with questions #9, #10, and #11, but I encourage her to review these concepts and ask questions during office hours or in class. Her participation was strong, and she\\u2019s showing good effort.\\n\\nChelsea\\u2019s most recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers earned a score of 91%, which is excellent. I recommend she watches the homework solution video and corrects any mistakes to reinforce her understanding.\\n\\nIf Chelsea would like extra practice, I can provide additional problems or she can work on the supplemental workbook. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings are available if she can\\u2019t attend live.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jingjing,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Emilia has been a focused and engaged participant in our recent math lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, as well as drawing and using trend lines to predict future values. She consistently kept her camera on and showed attentiveness throughout class, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nEmilia answered 12 in-class questions, with 10 correct and 1 partially correct (Question #3). She struggled most with Question #7, which she answered incorrectly. This indicates a small area where she could benefit from some additional practice to solidify her understanding. I encourage you to review these questions with her to help reinforce the concepts.\\n\\nShe missed 4 minutes of class due to a brief disconnection. To support continuous learning, please ensure her device connection is stable during lessons. If you encounter ongoing technical issues, Think customer service is available to assist.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, Emilia scored 69%. I recommend having her watch the homework solution video and revisit the problems she missed. To boost her confidence and skills, she can also work through extra problems in the workbook or request additional practice.\\n\\nPlease know Emilia is progressing well overall, and with a bit more focus on the areas mentioned, she will continue to improve. If you feel she would benefit from personalized support, remember that up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions are available this semester. You can book them here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can view Emilia\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5D6X.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Linda,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about April's progress in this week's math lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs.\\n\\nApril demonstrated excellent engagement throughout our classes. She kept her camera on consistently and was attentive during all instruction. Most importantly, her performance on in-class questions was strong\\u2014she answered 10 out of 12 questions correctly. She did encounter some difficulty with Question #11 and didn't respond to Question #3, so these are areas we can focus on together.\\n\\nI'm also pleased to report that April completed her previous homework assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators with a perfect 100% score. This shows she's mastering the foundational skills we've been building.\\n\\nTo help April continue this momentum, I'd like to suggest a few resources. If she'd like extra practice with line graphs and trend lines, we have supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I'm happy to provide additional problems upon request. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are also a great opportunity for her to ask questions and review any tricky concepts.\\n\\nIf April would benefit from more personalized support, she's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about her performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMdwK\\n\\nKeep up the great work, April! Looking forward to seeing you next week.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f311\\u670830\\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Linda\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5173\\u4e8eApril\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3002\\n\\nApril\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u6240\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u6781\\u597d\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5979\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u5728\\u6240\\u6709\\u6559\\u5b66\\u8fc7\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u90fd\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u3002\\u6700\\u91cd\\u8981\\u7684\\u662f\\uff0c\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f88\\u51fa\\u8272\\u2014\\u2014\\u5979\\u572812\\u9053\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8610\\u9053\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c11\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u662f\\u6211\\u4eec\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5173\\u6ce8\\u7684\\u9886\\u57df\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u5730\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff0cApril\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e86\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u8fbe\\u5230\\u4e86\\u5b8c\\u7f8e\\u7684100%\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u6b63\\u5728\\u638c\\u63e1\\u6211\\u4eec\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5728\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u7684\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u5e2e\\u52a9April\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u8fd9\\u79cd\\u52bf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u60f3\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u591a\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5728\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u4e50\\u610f\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e5f\\u662f\\u5979\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u548c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u68d8\\u624b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u597d\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cApril\\u80fd\\u4ece\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\u4e2d\\u53d7\\u76ca\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u8d44\\u683c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u3002\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u627e\\u5230\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMdwK\\n\\nApril\\uff0c\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u52a0\\u6cb9\\uff01\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u89c1\\u5230\\u4f60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Chris,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Yilan\\u2019s progress in this week\\u2019s math class. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nYilan was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, with her camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see. She answered 9 in-class questions: 2 were correct, 2 partially correct, 3 incorrect (specifically questions #4, #6, and #8), and 2 were left unanswered (#5 and #9). These results suggest that while she is grasping some concepts well, there are areas where she could use additional support.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtracting mixed numbers with borrowing, Yilan earned a 79%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video carefully to identify and correct any mistakes, which will reinforce her understanding. If she would like more practice, she can work on extra problems in the workbook or request additional exercises.\\n\\nPlease remind Yilan that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for extra help with homework or workbook questions. Also, she is eligible for up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on Yilan\\u2019s performance this week, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5DP5.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support. Together, we can help Yilan build confidence and mastery in these important math skills.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Chris\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bYilan\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u7528\\u5176\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\n\\nYilan\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u79ef\\u6781\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u4ee4\\u4eba\\u6b23\\u6170\\u3002\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e869\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff1a\\u5176\\u4e2d2\\u9898\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c2\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c3\\u9898\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u5177\\u4f53\\u662f\\u7b2c4\\u30016\\u548c8\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u8fd8\\u67092\\u9898\\u672a\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c5\\u548c9\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u7ed3\\u679c\\u663e\\u793a\\uff0c\\u5979\\u5bf9\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8f83\\u597d\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u67d0\\u4e9b\\u65b9\\u9762\\u4ecd\\u9700\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\uff08\\u5305\\u62ec\\u501f\\u4f4d\\uff09\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cYilan\\u5f97\\u4e8679%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u8ba4\\u771f\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u6790\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u627e\\u51fa\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u4e66\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u5411\\u6211\\u7d22\\u53d6\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192Yilan\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u6709\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u65b9\\u4fbf\\u5979\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u4e66\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u672c\\u5468Yilan\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5DP5\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5171\\u540c\\u52aa\\u529b\\uff0c\\u5e2e\\u52a9Yilan\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\uff0c\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u91cd\\u8981\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Travis has shown good engagement and attentiveness in class this week, consistently keeping his camera on, which helps maintain focus and participation. During our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and distinguishing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs, Travis answered 12 questions in class. He answered 5 correctly but struggled with questions #7, #11, and #12, and did not answer questions #1, #2, #3, and #8. This pattern suggests he might benefit from a little more practice with these concepts to build confidence and accuracy.\\n\\nFor homework, Travis scored 69% on subtraction of mixed numbers, including borrowing when necessary. I recommend encouraging him to watch the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes, which will reinforce his understanding.

She has been very engaged and attentive, consistently keeping her camera on, which helps her stay focused during lessons. Isabella answered 12 questions in class, getting 11 correct and only leaving one unanswered (question #3), showing strong understanding of the material we covered on line graphs and trend lines.\\n\\nFor homework, Isabella scored 92% on the subtraction of mixed numbers, which is a solid performance. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to review and correct any errors she made, as this will reinforce her learning.\\n\\nTo support her continued growth, she might benefit from trying some extra supplemental problems in the workbook, especially those related to this week\\u2019s topic. If you feel she needs additional practice or clarification, please let me know\\u2014I can provide more problems or recommend using our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app. Also, Isabella is eligible for up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester, which you can book anytime at the following link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about her in-class performance in the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXq6p.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support at home.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Joyce,\\n\\nI hope you\\u2019re having a wonderful week! I wanted to share some positive updates about Chelsea\\u2019s progress in math class. This week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Chelsea was fully engaged throughout the lesson, consistently kept her camera on, and answered all 12 in-class questions correctly. Her attentiveness and participation were truly impressive.\\n\\nChelsea also earned a perfect score on her previous homework assignment, which covered subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to review her work and correct any mistakes, even if she scored 100%. This will help reinforce her understanding and prepare her for future topics.\\n\\nIf Chelsea would like extra practice, I recommend working through the supplemental problems in the workbook. Additional problems are also available upon request. For any questions, she\\u2019s welcome to join our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, or review the recordings if she can\\u2019t attend live. She also has up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed performance information, you can view Chelsea\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v0lYLg.\\n\\nWishing you and your family a happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Joyce\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u672c\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bChelsea\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u79ef\\u6781\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u51fa\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u7528\\u5b83\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u800c\\u4e0d\\u662f\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u3002Chelsea\\u5728\\u6574\\u8282\\u8bfe\\u4e2d\\u90fd\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e1412\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u5168\\u90e8\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u3002\\u5979\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u975e\\u5e38\\u51fa\\u8272\\u3002\\n\\nChelsea\\u5728\\u4e0a\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u4e5f\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u6ee1\\u5206\\uff0c\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u662f\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u7684\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff0c\\u5305\\u62ec\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u7684\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5373\\u4f7f\\u5979\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u6ee1\\u5206\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u590d\\u4e60\\u6765\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u4e3a\\u63a5\\u4e0b\\u6765\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u505a\\u597d\\u51c6\\u5907\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cChelsea\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u89c6\\u9891\\u3002\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bChelsea\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v0lYLg\\u3002\\n\\n\\u795d\\u60a8\\u548c\\u5bb6\\u4eba\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4  \\nTeacher Omar\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Anna was engaged and kept her camera on consistently, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nHowever, Anna missed a significant portion of class, attending only 16 minutes out of 90, arriving late and leaving early. I understand that unexpected things can come up, but this likely contributed to her not answering any of the in-class questions (#1 through #9). There were also five disconnections during class, which may have interrupted her learning further. I encourage you to help Anna attend the full class session on time and troubleshoot any technical issues; Think customer service can assist if needed.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Anna scored 81% on her recent homework about subtracting mixed numbers. I recommend she watches the homework solution video to review and correct any mistakes. Additionally, she can practice extra problems in the workbook or request more exercises if helpful.\\n\\nPlease remind Anna that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for extra support.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Helena has been engaged and attentive in class this week, consistently keeping her camera on, which is wonderful to see. Our lessons focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when line graphs are preferable to bar graphs. Helena answered 12 in-class questions, with 3 correct, 1 partially correct, 4 incorrect (specifically questions #5, #7, #9, #10), and 4 unanswered (#1, #3, #11, #12). These missed and partially answered questions suggest she could benefit from additional practice to build confidence and accuracy with these concepts.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtracting mixed numbers, Helena scored 83%, which is a solid effort. To help her improve further, I encourage you to have her watch the homework solution video and revisit any mistakes she made. There are extra supplemental problems in the workbook available if she wishes to practice more, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nPlease also remind Helena about our weekly office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where she can get homework and workbook support. For more personalized help, remember she has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on Helena\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98PqL1.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Qiang,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Benjamin's progress in this week's math lessons on line graphs.\\n\\nBenjamin demonstrated excellent engagement and focus throughout our sessions. He answered 10 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, which shows strong understanding of the material. He did encounter some difficulty with questions #2 and #7, but these represent areas where he can deepen his skills with a bit more practice. His camera was consistently on, and his attentiveness in class was outstanding.\\n\\nI'm also pleased to report that Benjamin earned a perfect 100% on his previous homework assignment on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. This is a wonderful achievement and reflects his commitment to mastering the material!\\n\\nTo continue supporting Benjamin's growth, I'd recommend having him review the homework solution videos, particularly for any problems he found challenging. This will help reinforce his understanding and build confidence as he tackles new concepts.\\n\\nIf Benjamin would like additional practice beyond what we cover in class, we have several resources available: supplemental problems in the workbook, extra problems upon request, and office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework support. Benjamin also has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester if he'd like more personalized help: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about this week's performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xNLw\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in Benjamin's learning journey.

I want to share some updates on Grace\\u2019s progress in our recent math lessons. This week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Grace performed exceptionally well during class, answering all 10 in-class questions correctly and showing strong engagement throughout the lesson. She kept her camera on consistently, which helped maintain her focus and participation.\\n\\nGrace missed 3 minutes of class due to arriving a little late and experienced three brief disconnections during the session\\u2014one possibly during the break. I understand that unexpected things can come up, but I encourage you to help Grace attend on time and troubleshoot any technical issues to ensure she can fully benefit from the live instruction. If needed, Think Academy\\u2019s customer service is available for support.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtraction of mixed numbers, Grace scored 49%. I recommend having her watch the homework solution video and carefully correct her mistakes to build confidence and mastery in this area.

She was engaged and attentive throughout our lesson on line graphs, consistently keeping her camera on and participating actively. Aimee answered 12 questions in class, getting 10 correct, with only one incorrect answer (Question #9) and one unanswered (Question #8). These were small missteps, and I\\u2019m confident she can strengthen her understanding with a bit more practice.\\n\\nAimee did not complete her homework on subtraction of mixed numbers from last week. I encourage her to finish it as soon as possible and to make completing homework on time a priority moving forward. Consistent practice will help her build confidence and mastery in these important skills.\\n\\nFor extra support, I recommend working through the supplemental problems in the workbook, which provide additional practice on this week\\u2019s topics. If she needs more, I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some feedback on Tina's performance in this week's math class on line graphs and trend lines.\\n\\nTina was engaged and attentive throughout class, which I really appreciated. Her camera was on the entire time, showing she was present and ready to learn. However, I noticed she left class early and missed the final 31 minutes. I understand that sometimes things come up, and I want to gently encourage you to help ensure she stays for the full 90-minute class period when possible. This matters because she didn't have the opportunity to answer the final questions (#4, #5, #6, and #7), which were important for reinforcing the day's concepts.\\n\\nDuring the questions we did cover, Tina answered 2 correctly and had 1 partially correct response (Question #3). This shows she's building understanding, but there's room to strengthen her grasp of these concepts.\\n\\nOn the bright side, Tina scored 100% on her previous homework assignment on mixed number subtraction\\u2014excellent work! For her current homework, I encourage her to watch the solution video and carefully review any corrections needed. This will help her solidify her skills before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Tina's learning going forward, I'd recommend she explore the extra supplemental problems in the workbook to build confidence with line graphs. She's also welcome to request additional practice problems. Our office hours resume next Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app if she'd like live homework help. Additionally, Tina can book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yo0je\\n\\nI'm confident that with consistent attendance and a bit of extra practice, Tina will master these concepts!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f311\\u670830\\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u95ed\\u6821\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u5ea6\\u8fc7\\u4e86\\u7f8e\\u597d\\u7684\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eabTina\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e2d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nTina\\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e2d\\u90fd\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u4e14\\u8ba4\\u771f\\uff0c\\u6211\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6b23\\u8d4f\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u70b9\\u3002\\u5979\\u7684\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u5728\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u51c6\\u5907\\u597d\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u3002\\u4f46\\u662f\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u5979\\u63d0\\u524d\\u79bb\\u5f00\\u4e86\\u8bfe\\u5802\\uff0c\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u4e86\\u6700\\u540e31\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\u6211\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u53d1\\u751f\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u4e8b\\u60c5\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u6e29\\u548c\\u5730\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u60a8\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5c3d\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u5b8c\\u6574\\u5730\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6574\\u4e2a90\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5f88\\u91cd\\u8981\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u6700\\u540e\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff08\\u7b2c#4\\u3001#5\\u3001#6\\u548c#7\\u9898\\uff09\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u95ee\\u9898\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5f53\\u5929\\u7684\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u81f3\\u5173\\u91cd\\u8981\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6db5\\u76d6\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\uff0cTina\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e862\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u67091\\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u7684\\u56de\\u7b54\\uff08\\u7b2c#3\\u9898\\uff09\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u6b63\\u5728\\u9010\\u6b65\\u7406\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5728\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u65b9\\u9762\\u8fd8\\u6709\\u6539\\u8fdb\\u7684\\u7a7a\\u95f4\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4ee4\\u4eba\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u7684\\u662f\\uff0cTina\\u5728\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a100%\\u2014\\u2014\\u505a\\u5f97\\u5f88\\u597d\\uff01\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u76ee\\u524d\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u89e3\\u9898\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u4ed4\\u7ec6\\u67e5\\u770b\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u6b63\\u7684\\u5730\\u65b9\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5728\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5979\\u7684\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301Tina\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u63a2\\u7d22\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u5bf9\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e5f\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u8981\\u6c42\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u901a\\u8fc7Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u6062\\u590d\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0cTina\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a3\\u4e2a\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yo0je\\n\\n\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u575a\\u6301\\u51fa\\u52e4\\u548c\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0cTina\\u5c06\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

This week, we focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines, and understand when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Lucas was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on, which helps foster a positive classroom environment.\\n\\nIn class, Lucas answered 12 questions, with 3 correct, 3 partially correct, and 5 incorrect. He did not answer one question. The questions he struggled with were #3, #4, #6, #11, and #12. I encourage Lucas to review these concepts, as they are important for building a strong foundation in data analysis. He did well with questions #2, #5, and #10, showing he is starting to grasp some of the key ideas.\\n\\nLucas did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers. I encourage him to finish this assignment and to make completing homework on time a priority moving forward.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share some feedback about Jesse\\u2019s progress this week. He was excited and enthusiastic in class, and I appreciate how consistently he kept his camera on\\u2014it really helps build a positive classroom environment. Jesse attended 86 minutes of our 90-minute lesson, missing just 4 minutes, and I encourage you to help him troubleshoot any technical issues that might have caused his brief disconnection. If needed, Think customer service is available to assist.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Jesse answered 9 in-class questions, getting 8 correct and 1 incorrect (question #9). He did a great job overall, but I recommend reviewing question #9 together to clarify any misunderstandings. The in-class report with more details is available here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JdMdwP.\\n\\nJesse\\u2019s most recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers earned an 87%. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to reinforce his learning. For extra practice, supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and additional problems can be provided upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings are available for those who can\\u2019t attend live.

Amy has shown excellent engagement and attentiveness in class this week while learning how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines, and distinguish when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. She answered 11 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, which is a strong performance. The only question she struggled with was question #12, so reviewing that together could be helpful.\\n\\nAmy\\u2019s homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators scored 92%, reflecting solid understanding. To support her continued progress, I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes she made. This will reinforce her skills and boost her confidence.\\n\\nShe consistently kept her camera on during class, which I appreciate as it helps maintain focus and interaction. If Amy would like additional practice, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I can provide more upon request.\\n\\nPlease remind Amy about our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework or workbook problems if needed. Also, remember that Amy can use up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester if she wants more personalized support; you can book those sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on Amy\\u2019s in-class performance, please feel free to review the report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jg5DPX.\\n\\nThank you for your support at home.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Yunxi has had a strong week in class as we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. She demonstrated great engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on consistently, which positively contributed to her learning environment.\\n\\nYunxi answered 9 out of 10 in-class questions correctly, with the only challenge arising on question #7. I encourage her to review this question to build further confidence in this area. Her previous homework on subtracting mixed numbers, including borrowing when necessary, was completed perfectly with a score of 100%. Watching the homework solution video together could help reinforce her understanding and maintain this strong performance.\\n\\nTo support Yunxi\\u2019s continued progress, she might benefit from extra practice with supplemental problems in the workbook. If you would like, I can provide additional problems tailored to her needs. Also, please remember that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook assistance. Recordings of classes and office hours are accessible if she cannot attend live.\\n\\nIf you feel Yunxi would benefit from more personalized support, we offer up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester, which you can schedule here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed insights into Yunxi\\u2019s performance, you can view the full in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JYdAjK.\\n\\nPlease don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Emma's performance in this week's math class on graphing and data interpretation.\\n\\nEmma demonstrated excellent engagement throughout the lesson. She was attentive, kept her camera on consistently, and participated actively in our discussion about plotting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and comparing different graph types. Out of 12 in-class questions, Emma answered 10 correctly\\u2014a strong showing! She did encounter some difficulty with Question #11, and Question #8 was partially correct. These represent great learning opportunities, and I'm confident that with a bit more practice in these specific areas, she'll master this content.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Emma scored 92% on the subtraction of mixed numbers assignment. This is a solid performance! I'd encourage her to review the homework solution video to understand the questions she missed, as this will reinforce her understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo continue building momentum, I recommend Emma explore the supplemental problems in the workbook for extra practice on this week's graphing concepts. If she'd like additional support, office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT are a great resource for homework and workbook help. She also has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester if she'd benefit from personalized instruction: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in Emma's in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RDXq6A\\n\\nEmma is off to a great start with this unit.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Sophie,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Chloe had a wonderful week in class, showing great engagement and attentiveness throughout our lessons. She consistently kept her camera on, which helped her stay focused and interact actively with the material. This week, we explored how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines to predict future values, and distinguish when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nChloe answered 12 in-class questions with 11 correct responses, which is excellent. She only missed question #9, so I recommend reviewing this question together to help her fully grasp that concept. Her participation has been strong, and she seems confident with the current material.\\n\\nRegarding her homework on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, Chloe scored 100%, which reflects her solid understanding.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share some thoughtful feedback about Elizabeth\\u2019s progress this week. She continues to be engaged and attentive in class, and I appreciate how consistently she keeps her camera on\\u2014this helps her stay connected and involved in our lessons.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, how to draw trend lines, and when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Elizabeth answered 12 questions in class, getting 9 correct and missing 2 (questions #9 and #12). She did not answer question #8. These are small areas we can work on, and I encourage her to review the class recording and try a few extra problems from the workbook to reinforce her understanding.\\n\\nHer most recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers earned an 88%. That\\u2019s a strong score, and I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to deepen her learning. If she would like more practice, I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems.\\n\\nFor extra support, Elizabeth is welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, or she can access recordings of our sessions. She also has up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share some positive updates about Lionel\\u2019s progress in math this week. He was engaged and attentive during our lessons, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on throughout class. Lionel answered 10 questions in class this week, getting 9 correct and 1 partially correct. The partially correct answer was on question #3, which is a good opportunity for him to review that concept further. I encourage him to revisit the class recording and the in-class report for more details: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9KgAP0.\\n\\nLionel\\u2019s homework score was 92%, which is excellent. I recommend that he watches the homework solution video and corrects any mistakes to reinforce his understanding. If he would like more practice, there are extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and additional problems are available upon request.\\n\\nFor extra support, our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework and workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. If Lionel would benefit from more individualized attention, he is welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and I look forward to helping Lionel continue to grow in his math skills.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bLionel\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u79ef\\u6781\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\uff0c\\u800c\\u4e14\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u90fd\\u6253\\u5f00\\u4e86\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u6211\\u975e\\u5e38\\u611f\\u8c22\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468Lionel\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8610\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d9\\u4e2a\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u662f\\u7b2c3\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5bf9\\u4ed6\\u6765\\u8bf4\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u590d\\u4e60\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u548c\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff0c\\u4e86\\u89e3\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec6\\u8282\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9KgAP0\\u3002\\n\\nLionel\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a92%\\uff0c\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4f18\\u79c0\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u968f\\u65f6\\u5411\\u6211\\u7d22\\u53d6\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08PDT\\uff09\\uff0c\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5f97\\u5230\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u95ee\\u9898\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u4e5f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u7ed9\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u5b66\\u751f\\u3002\\u5982\\u679cLionel\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u6211\\u671f\\u5f85\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u5e2e\\u52a9Lionel\\u63d0\\u5347\\u6570\\u5b66\\u80fd\\u529b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\uff0c  \\nTeacher Omar\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

This shows she's retaining previous concepts well while learning new material.\\n\\nTo continue building momentum, I'd recommend having Tiffany watch the homework solution video and review any corrections needed.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Ruima,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful week! I wanted to share some feedback on Madelyn's performance in this week's math class, where we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and determining when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nMadelyn was engaged and attentive throughout class, and I appreciated seeing her camera on and actively participating. She answered 12 in-class questions with strong overall performance\\u20148 correct answers and 1 partially correct. However, I did notice she struggled with questions #9 and #12, and didn't have a chance to answer question #1. I suspect the missed question at the start of class may have been due to her arriving a few minutes late. I know things come up, but I'd gently encourage you to help Madelyn arrive on time when possible, as it ensures she doesn't miss important foundational concepts we cover early in the lesson. She also experienced one brief disconnection during class; if you notice any ongoing technical issues, Think's customer service team can help troubleshoot.\\n\\nOn the homework front (subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators), Madelyn scored 63%. I'd recommend having her review the homework solution video to see where adjustments are needed\\u2014this will really solidify her understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Madelyn's growth, I'd suggest exploring the supplemental problems in her workbook or requesting additional practice problems. She's also welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework help, or she can book one of her free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JPaAx5\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in Madelyn's learning!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01\\u601d\\u8003\\u5b66\\u9662\\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u81f311\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5173\\u95ed\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u745e\\u739b\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab\\u739b\\u5fb7\\u7433\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u4e0e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\n\\n\\u739b\\u5fb7\\u7433\\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u90fd\\u5f88\\u6295\\u5165\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u770b\\u5230\\u5979\\u5f00\\u542f\\u4e86\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5e76\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u3002\\u5979\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u603b\\u4f53\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f88\\u597d\\u2014\\u20148\\u9053\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\uff0c1\\u9053\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c9\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c12\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u800c\\u4e14\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u7b2c1\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u6000\\u7591\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u59cb\\u65f6\\u6f0f\\u6389\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u8fdf\\u5230\\u4e86\\u51e0\\u5206\\u949f\\u3002\\u6211\\u77e5\\u9053\\u6709\\u65f6\\u4f1a\\u6709\\u7a81\\u53d1\\u60c5\\u51b5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u6211\\u6e29\\u548c\\u5730\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4f60\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u739b\\u5fb7\\u7433\\u5c3d\\u91cf\\u51c6\\u65f6\\u5230\\u8bfe\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6837\\u5979\\u5c31\\u4e0d\\u4f1a\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u59cb\\u65f6\\u8bb2\\u6388\\u7684\\u91cd\\u8981\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e2d\\u8fd8\\u7ecf\\u5386\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u77ed\\u6682\\u7684\\u6389\\u7ebf\\uff1b\\u5982\\u679c\\u4f60\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7684\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u601d\\u8003\\u5b66\\u9662\\u7684\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u56e2\\u961f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u6392\\u67e5\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff08\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff09\\uff0c\\u739b\\u5fb7\\u7433\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a63%\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u8ba9\\u5979\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u770b\\u770b\\u54ea\\u4e9b\\u5730\\u65b9\\u9700\\u8981\\u8c03\\u6574\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u771f\\u6b63\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5979\\u5728\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u524d\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301\\u739b\\u5fb7\\u7433\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u63a2\\u7d22\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u914d\\u5957\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u6216\\u7d22\\u53d6\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u5979\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff08\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\uff09\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JPaAx5\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u4f60\\u5728\\u739b\\u5fb7\\u7433\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5408\\u4f5c\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\n\\u6b27\\u9ea6\\u5c14\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share some feedback about Owen\\u2019s performance this week. He was engaged and attentive during class, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on throughout the session. This week, we focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines, and decide when to use a line graph versus a bar graph.\\n\\nOwen answered 7 out of 9 in-class questions correctly. He missed question #9 and did not answer question #1. I noticed he was not home at the start of class and did not have his book, which is likely why he missed the first question. He arrived late and missed about 4 minutes of class. Sometimes things come up, but I encourage you to help Owen arrive on time so he doesn\\u2019t miss important instructions. He also had two brief disconnections during class, one of which may have been due to the break. If technical issues continue, please reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nOwen\\u2019s previous homework score was 92%, which is excellent.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you\\u2019re doing well. I wanted to share some feedback about Bryson\\u2019s progress in math class this week. He was engaged and attentive throughout our lessons, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on, which helps us stay connected during class.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, how to draw trend lines, and when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Bryson answered 12 in-class questions, getting 10 correct and 2 incorrect (questions #7 and #11). These were small missteps, and I encourage him to review those questions using the in-class report, which you can find here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vQXAk8. He\\u2019s doing well overall, and with a bit more practice, I\\u2019m confident he\\u2019ll master these concepts.\\n\\nHis most recent homework score was 79%. I recommend that Bryson watch the homework solution video and correct his mistakes to reinforce his understanding. If he needs extra practice, there are supplemental problems in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request.\\n\\nFor extra support, our office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework and workbook questions. Recordings of classes and office hours are also available if he can\\u2019t attend live.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Grace,\\n\\nI wanted to share some feedback about Josiah\\u2019s performance in math class this week. He did a wonderful job engaging with the material on line graphs, including how to plot them, draw trend lines, and use those lines to make predictions. Josiah answered 12 in-class questions this week, getting 11 correct and 1 partially correct. The question he found a bit tricky was question #2, which is a great opportunity for him to review and strengthen his understanding. I encourage him to watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to reinforce his learning.\\n\\nJosiah was attentive and engaged throughout most of the class, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on. He missed just 1 minute of class due to a brief disconnection, which is common with online learning. If technical issues continue, please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nHis previous homework on subtracting mixed numbers was completed with a perfect score\\u2014well done! For extra practice, I recommend working through the supplemental problems in the workbook. Additional problems are also available upon request, and he\\u2019s always welcome to join our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework or workbook help. Recordings of classes and office hours are available if he can\\u2019t attend live.\\n\\nIf Josiah would like more personalized support, he can book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/. For more detailed performance information, you can view his in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jp5P02.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support!\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Grace\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bJosiah\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u65b9\\u9762\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u51fa\\u8272\\uff0c\\u5305\\u62ec\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7528\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468Josiah\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d11\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u9053\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u89c9\\u5f97\\u7a0d\\u5fae\\u6709\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\u7684\\u662f\\u7b2c2\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5bf9\\u4ed6\\u6765\\u8bf4\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u590d\\u4e60\\u548c\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7406\\u89e3\\u7684\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u6240\\u5b66\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u3002\\n\\nJosiah\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5927\\u90e8\\u5206\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u90fd\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u4ed6\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u56e0\\u77ed\\u6682\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\u53ea\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u4e861\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u5728\\u5728\\u7ebf\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u5f88\\u5e38\\u89c1\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6301\\u7eed\\u51fa\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u5bfb\\u6c42\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4ed6\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u4e86\\u6ee1\\u5206\\uff0c\\u505a\\u5f97\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\uff01\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u968f\\u65f6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student app\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u6216\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u968f\\u65f6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679cJosiah\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jp5P02\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4ee5\\u6765\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. This week, Siyan has been actively engaged and attentive during our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines for prediction, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. She consistently kept her camera on, which helped maintain her focus throughout class.\\n\\nSiyan answered 12 in-class questions, with 7 correct, 2 partially correct, and 3 incorrect. The questions she struggled with were #6, #10, and #12, while she was partially correct on #3 and #8. These results indicate that while she has a good grasp of the concepts, there are specific areas within the lesson where she could benefit from additional practice.\\n\\nHer recent homework on subtraction of mixed numbers, including borrowing when necessary, scored well at 92%. I encourage you to have Siyan watch the homework solution video to review her mistakes and reinforce her understanding.\\n\\nTo support her progress, I recommend she work on the extra supplemental problems in her workbook, which can deepen her skills with line graph interpretation and trend analysis. Please feel free to request additional problems if you think she would benefit from more practice. Also, remind her that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for any homework or workbook questions.\\n\\nIf you think Siyan would benefit from more personalized support, remember she has access to up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on her performance, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/v1N1LD.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support in Siyan\\u2019s learning journey.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Peggy,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive news about Wilson's progress in math this week.\\n\\nWilson had an excellent week in class. He answered all 12 in-class questions correctly and demonstrated consistent engagement throughout the lesson. His camera was on the entire time, and his attentiveness was truly impressive. It's clear that Wilson is absorbing the material on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use different graph types.\\n\\nI do want to address his homework performance this week. Wilson scored 79% on his assignment on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. While this shows solid understanding, there's room for improvement. I'd encourage Wilson to watch the homework solution video and work through the problems he missed. This will help him strengthen his skills before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Wilson's continued growth, here are some resources I'd recommend:\\n\\n- The supplemental problems in the workbook offer extra practice opportunities\\n- Our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are perfect for homework help\\n- If Wilson would benefit from more personalized support, he's eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nI'm excited to continue working with Wilson next week. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nFor detailed performance information, please visit: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yo04e\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u5230 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5173\\u95ed\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 Peggy\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5173\\u4e8e Wilson \\u8fd9\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u7684\\u597d\\u6d88\\u606f\\u3002\\n\\nWilson \\u8fd9\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u8272\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86\\u5168\\u90e8 12 \\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u6253\\u5f00\\u4e86\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u4e5f\\u975e\\u5e38\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\u3002\\u5f88\\u660e\\u663e Wilson \\u6b63\\u5728\\u638c\\u63e1\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u91ca\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u7406\\u89e3\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u4e0d\\u540c\\u56fe\\u8868\\u7c7b\\u578b\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u63d0\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u4ed6\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002Wilson \\u5728\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u7684\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e0a\\u5f97\\u4e86 79 \\u5206\\u3002\\u867d\\u7136\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u6709\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u4ecd\\u6709\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u7684\\u7a7a\\u95f4\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae Wilson \\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u65b9\\u6848\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u9010\\u4e2a\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u4ed6\\u505a\\u9519\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u524d\\u8fdb\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Wilson \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u6211\\u63a8\\u8350\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff1a\\n\\n- \\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u4e86\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u673a\\u4f1a\\n- \\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u975e\\u5e38\\u9002\\u5408\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\n- \\u5982\\u679c Wilson \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u8d44\\u683c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u6211\\u5f88\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u4e0e Wilson \\u5408\\u4f5c\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u4f60\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\\n\\n\\u6709\\u5173\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u8bbf\\u95ee\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9yo04e\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

With a bit of focused review on those challenging questions, I'm confident she'll continue progressing.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\uff09\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab Stephanie \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u5206\\u6790\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nStephanie \\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5f3a\\u70c8\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u542f\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5e76\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728 12 \\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e86 10 \\u9053\\uff0c\\u663e\\u793a\\u51fa\\u5bf9\\u6559\\u6750\\u7684\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c 6 \\u548c\\u7b2c 7 \\u9053\\u9898\\u76ee\\u4e2d\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u65f6\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u77ed\\u6682\\u7684\\u6389\\u7ebf\\u2014\\u2014\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u9047\\u5230\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7684\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0cThink \\u7684\\u5ba2\\u6237\\u670d\\u52a1\\u56e2\\u961f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u6392\\u67e5\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\uff0cStephanie \\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u662f 72%\\u3002\\u867d\\u7136\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u6b63\\u5728\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u4ecd\\u6709\\u6539\\u8fdb\\u7684\\u7a7a\\u95f4\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5979\\u505a\\u9519\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u7406\\u89e3\\u9700\\u8981\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u7684\\u8c03\\u6574\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Stephanie \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u63a8\\u8350\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff1a\\n\\n- \\u8ba9\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u76ee\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u5fc3\\n- \\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u7684\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\n- \\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0cStephanie \\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n- \\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u53ef\\u4f9b\\u4f7f\\u7528\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JjL8Er\\n\\nStephanie \\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u987a\\u5229\\uff01\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u5bf9\\u90a3\\u4e9b\\u5177\\u6709\\u6311\\u6218\\u6027\\u95ee\\u9898\\u7684\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\u590d\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u5979\\u4f1a\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u53d6\\u5f97\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback on Sarah\\u2019s progress in math class this week. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nSarah attended most of the class, missing only 2 minutes, which I noticed might have contributed to her not answering questions #1, #3, #8, #9, and #12. I understand that sometimes things come up, but I encourage your support in helping her arrive on time so she can fully benefit from the lesson. She was engaged and attentive throughout, with her camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see.\\n\\nIn-class, Sarah answered 12 questions, getting 6 correct and 1 incorrect (#10). The unanswered questions were mostly at the start of class, likely due to her late arrival. Encouraging her to review these early questions would help solidify her understanding.\\n\\nHer recent homework on subtraction of mixed numbers scored 81%. I recommend that Sarah watch the homework solution video and correct any mistakes to strengthen her skills.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Dominic's performance in this week's math class on line graphs and trend lines.\\n\\nDominic demonstrated strong engagement throughout our 90-minute session. He was attentive, kept his camera on, and actively participated in our discussion. Out of 12 in-class questions, he answered 9 correctly, which shows solid understanding of the material. I did notice he found questions #7 and #10 challenging, and he didn't attempt question #3. These particular questions likely touched on some of the more complex applications we covered, so this is a great opportunity for targeted practice.\\n\\nI do want to address one concern: Dominic did not complete last week's homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I'd like to encourage him to finish this assignment, as it builds foundational skills we'll continue building on. Going forward, completing homework on time is really important for reinforcing what we learn in class and identifying any gaps early.\\n\\nTo support Dominic's continued growth, I'd recommend he review the extra supplemental problems in the workbook related to this week's topics. He's also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT through the Think Student app for additional homework and workbook help. If he'd benefit from more personalized support, Dominic qualifies for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5qWQ\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Dominic's math journey!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u5ea6\\u8fc7\\u7f8e\\u597d\\u65f6\\u5149\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u5173\\u4e8e Dominic \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff08\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\uff09\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nDominic \\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a 90 \\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5f88\\u5f3a\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u542f\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u3002\\u5728 12 \\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86 9 \\u4e2a\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u5bf9\\u6240\\u5b66\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u6709\\u4e86\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u6211\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c 7 \\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c 10 \\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u800c\\u4e14\\u4ed6\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7b2c 3 \\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u7279\\u5b9a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u6d89\\u53ca\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6240\\u8bb2\\u6388\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u4e2d\\u8f83\\u4e3a\\u590d\\u6742\\u7684\\u5e94\\u7528\\uff0c\\u6240\\u4ee5\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u6709\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u6027\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u7684\\u5f88\\u597d\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u786e\\u5b9e\\u60f3\\u6307\\u51fa\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u9700\\u8981\\u5173\\u6ce8\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff1aDominic \\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\uff08\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\uff09\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u8fd9\\u9879\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u5b83\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u4e86\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5c06\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u53d1\\u5c55\\u7684\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\u4eca\\u540e\\uff0c\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u5f3a\\u5316\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5b66\\u5230\\u7684\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u548c\\u53ca\\u65e9\\u53d1\\u73b0\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u6f0f\\u6d1e\\u975e\\u5e38\\u91cd\\u8981\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Dominic \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u4e0e\\u672c\\u5468\\u4e3b\\u9898\\u76f8\\u5173\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u901a\\u8fc7 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u4e3e\\u884c\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c Dominic \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u591a\\u8fbe 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u8ba2\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchoolMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RB5qWQ\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u5728\\u652f\\u6301 Dominic \\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5408\\u4f5c\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to share an update on Eva\\u2019s progress in our recent math lessons. This week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nEva was engaged and attentive throughout class, and she kept her camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see. She missed 3 minutes of class and experienced two disconnections during the lesson; one may have been related to the break. To help Eva maintain continuous attendance and avoid interruptions, please consider checking her internet connection or device. If needed, Think customer service is available for technical support.\\n\\nDuring class, Eva answered 12 questions but had difficulty with questions #4, #7, #9, #10, and #11, where she answered incorrectly. She also left questions #1, #2, #3, and #8 unanswered. I encourage Eva to review these areas, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems if that would be helpful.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Eva did not complete the assignment on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. Completing homework on time is important to reinforce concepts covered in class. Please encourage her to complete this homework, and remind her that extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I am always happy to provide more as needed.\\n\\nI also want to remind you that Eva can join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for extra help, and recordings are available if she cannot attend live. Additionally, she has up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on Eva\\u2019s class performance, please feel free to review the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vQXAby.\\n\\nThank you for your support in Eva\\u2019s learning journey. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can assist you or Eva further.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u5c0a\\u656c\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\u60a8\\u597d\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5411\\u60a8\\u6c47\\u62a5\\u4e00\\u4e0bEva\\u5728\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u5229\\u7528\\u5b83\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\n\\nEva\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u79ef\\u6781\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u6253\\u5f00\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8ba9\\u6211\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u3002\\u5979\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e863\\u5206\\u949f\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u671f\\u95f4\\u6709\\u4e24\\u6b21\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u662f\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u4f11\\u606f\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u5bfc\\u81f4\\u7684\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u5e2e\\u52a9Eva\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u8fde\\u7eed\\u51fa\\u52e4\\u5e76\\u907f\\u514d\\u4e2d\\u65ad\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u60a8\\u68c0\\u67e5\\u5979\\u7684\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u8fde\\u63a5\\u6216\\u8bbe\\u5907\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0cThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u6280\\u672f\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002\\n\\n\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\uff0cEva\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5728\\u7b2c4\\u30017\\u30019\\u300110\\u548c11\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u7b54\\u9519\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u7b2c1\\u30012\\u30013\\u548c8\\u9898\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u4f5c\\u7b54\\u3002\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1Eva\\u590d\\u4e60\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4e3a\\u5979\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cEva\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5bf9\\u4e8e\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u975e\\u5e38\\u91cd\\u8981\\u3002\\u8bf7\\u60a8\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u63d0\\u9192\\u5979\\u8bfe\\u672c\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u4e50\\u610f\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u8981\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u53e6\\u5916\\uff0cEva\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u989d\\u5916\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u64ad\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u76841\\u5bf91\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u70b9\\u51fb\\u6b64\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bEva\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vQXAby\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u5bf9Eva\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Lin,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Yifeng's performance in this week's math class on graphing and data interpretation.\\n\\nYifeng demonstrated strong engagement throughout the lesson, with his camera consistently on and his attention focused on the material. During our in-class questions, he answered 12 questions total, getting 9 of them completely correct. This shows solid understanding of the core concepts we covered. He did encounter some difficulty with Question #4, and Questions #2 and #3 required some refinement, but these are great opportunities for growth.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Yifeng scored 81% on the mixed number subtraction problems. This is a respectable score, though there's room for improvement. I'd like to encourage him to watch the homework solution video and work through the problems he missed. This will help him solidify his understanding of borrowing from whole numbers when needed.\\n\\nTo support Yifeng's continued progress, here are some resources I'd recommend:\\n- Extra supplemental problems are available in the workbook for additional practice\\n- Office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are perfect for homework help\\n- If he'd like more personalized support, Yifeng can book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWq6W\\n\\nKeep up the great work, Yifeng! I'm looking forward to seeing his progress continue.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 Lin\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u5173\\u4e8e Yifeng \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff08\\u56fe\\u8868\\u548c\\u6570\\u636e\\u89e3\\u91ca\\uff09\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nYifeng \\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u5f3a\\u70c8\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5904\\u4e8e\\u6253\\u5f00\\u72b6\\u6001\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\u5728\\u6559\\u6750\\u4e0a\\u3002\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u603b\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86 12 \\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d 9 \\u4e2a\\u7b54\\u6848\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u5bf9\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6240\\u8bb2\\u6388\\u7684\\u6838\\u5fc3\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u6709\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c 4 \\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u7b2c 2 \\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c 3 \\u9898\\u9700\\u8981\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u6539\\u8fdb\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u90fd\\u662f\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u6210\\u957f\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cYifeng \\u5728\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a 81%\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u4e0d\\u9519\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u4ecd\\u6709\\u6539\\u8fdb\\u7684\\u7a7a\\u95f4\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u65b9\\u6848\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4ed6\\u505a\\u9519\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u4ed6\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u5728\\u9700\\u8981\\u65f6\\u4ece\\u6574\\u6570\\u4e2d\\u501f\\u4f4d\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Yifeng \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff1a\\n- \\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u4f9b\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\n- \\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u7a0b\\u5e8f\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u975e\\u5e38\\u9002\\u5408\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\n- \\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u60f3\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0cYifeng \\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JGWq6W\\n\\n\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u52a0\\u6cb9\\uff0cYifeng\\uff01\\u6211\\u671f\\u5f85\\u770b\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u53d1\\u5c55\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jiting,  \\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to check in regarding Tyler\\u2019s attendance this week, as he was absent from our lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, including drawing trend lines and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. I understand that with Thanksgiving coming up next week, you may have had holiday events or travel plans. Please know that if you need any support with rescheduling or transferring class times to better fit your schedule, I am happy to help coordinate that.  \\n\\nThough Tyler missed the class, I encourage him to watch the recording to stay caught up with the material. For homework, Tyler scored 31% on the subtraction of mixed numbers assignment. It would be beneficial for him to review the homework solution video and correct his mistakes, as this will strengthen his understanding, especially of borrowing from whole numbers when needed.  \\n\\nTo support Tyler further, there are extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I can provide additional practice problems upon request. Also, please remind him about our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework and workbook questions. If you feel Tyler would benefit from more personalized instruction, remember that up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester are available, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nThank you for your attention.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Rachel,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some feedback on Audrey's performance in this week's math class on line graphs and trend analysis.\\n\\nAudrey was engaged and attentive throughout class, which I really appreciated. She had her camera on and was actively participating. However, she did experience a few technical disconnections during the session, so she missed about 22 minutes of class time. I'd encourage you to help troubleshoot any connectivity issues on her end\\u2014Think Academy's customer service team can also assist if needed.\\n\\nDuring our in-class practice, Audrey answered 12 questions total, getting 4 correct. She struggled with questions #5, #6, #7, #10, #11, and #12, and didn't attempt questions #8 and #9. This tells me she may benefit from additional practice with the concepts we covered this week.\\n\\nI also noticed that Audrey didn't complete her homework from last week on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I'd like to encourage her to go back and finish that assignment, as it builds important foundational skills. Moving forward, completing homework on time will really help her solidify these concepts.\\n\\nTo support Audrey's learning, I'd recommend working through the extra supplemental problems in her workbook, or she can request additional practice problems from me. She's also welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework help. If she'd benefit from more focused support, Audrey qualifies for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in her in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ5eq\\n\\nI'm confident that with consistent practice and effort, Audrey will master these skills. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\uff09\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\uff08\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 Rachel\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u4f60\\u5728\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u4f60\\u5206\\u4eab Audrey \\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u7684\\u53cd\\u9988\\uff0c\\u672c\\u5468\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u662f\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u5206\\u6790\\u3002\\n\\nAudrey \\u5728\\u6574\\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u548c\\u8ba4\\u771f\\uff0c\\u6211\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6b23\\u8d4f\\u8fd9\\u4e00\\u70b9\\u3002\\u5979\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u6253\\u5f00\\u4e86\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u3002\\u4f46\\u662f\\uff0c\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u7ecf\\u5386\\u4e86\\u51e0\\u6b21\\u6280\\u672f\\u65ad\\u8fde\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u6b64\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u4e86\\u5927\\u7ea6 22 \\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4f60\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u6392\\u67e5\\u8fde\\u63a5\\u95ee\\u9898\\u2014\\u2014\\u5982\\u679c\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0cThink Academy \\u7684\\u5ba2\\u6237\\u670d\\u52a1\\u56e2\\u961f\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\uff0cAudrey \\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86 12 \\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d 4 \\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c 5\\u30016\\u30017\\u300110\\u300111 \\u548c 12 \\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5c1d\\u8bd5\\u7b2c 8 \\u548c 9 \\u9898\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u5979\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u672c\\u5468\\u6240\\u5b66\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u8fd8\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u5230 Audrey \\u6ca1\\u6709\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u56de\\u53bb\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u90a3\\u9879\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u8fd9\\u80fd\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u91cd\\u8981\\u7684\\u57fa\\u7840\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\u4eca\\u540e\\uff0c\\u6309\\u65f6\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5c06\\u771f\\u6b63\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Audrey \\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u5728\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u505a\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6216\\u8005\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5411\\u6211\\u8981\\u6c42\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u3002\\u5979\\u4e5f\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c Audrey \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u6709\\u9488\\u5bf9\\u6027\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u8d44\\u683c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u5979\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vrZ5eq\\n\\n\\u6211\\u76f8\\u4fe1\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u6301\\u7eed\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u548c\\u52aa\\u529b\\uff0cAudrey \\u5c06\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6280\\u80fd\\u3002\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

She was absent for the lesson on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line versus bar graphs. I noticed I did not receive a prior notification about her absence. I completely understand that things come up, especially with Thanksgiving just around the corner, which might mean family events or travel plans. If your schedule requires, please know we are happy to assist with rescheduling or transferring lesson times to better accommodate Julia.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Julia did not complete last week\\u2019s assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from the whole number when needed. Completing this homework is important as it reinforces foundational skills that support upcoming topics. I encourage Julia to finish it soon and aim to submit future homework on time to keep pace with the class.\\n\\nTo help Julia catch up on missed content and practice, we have extra supplemental problems available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great opportunity for homework and workbook assistance.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Kiki,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Zack has been engaged and attentive in class this week, with his camera consistently on, which helps me support him better during lessons. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nZack answered 10 in-class questions, with 3 correct, 3 partially correct, and 4 incorrect. He struggled most with questions #2, #6, #7, and #10, so I encourage extra practice on these areas to build confidence. His partial answers on questions #1, #3, and #8 show he is on the right track but could benefit from clarification.\\n\\nFor homework, Zack scored 42% on subtraction of mixed numbers, including borrowing when necessary. To improve, please encourage him to watch the homework solution video carefully and correct his mistakes. Additional practice problems in the workbook are also available, and I\\u2019m happy to provide more upon request.\\n\\nZack can attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for extra support, especially with homework or workbook questions. Also, remember he has up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which could be a great option to address specific challenges.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Emily,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful week! I wanted to share some feedback about Ethan\\u2019s progress in math class this week. Ethan was engaged and attentive throughout our lesson on line graphs, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on, which helps create a positive learning environment.\\n\\nIn class, Ethan answered 12 questions, getting 6 correct, 2 partially correct, and 4 incorrect (questions #4, #6, #9, and #12). He did a great job staying focused and participating, and I noticed he was especially thoughtful during our group discussions. For the questions he missed, I encourage him to review the class recordings and try the extra supplemental problems in the workbook, which will help reinforce the concepts. If he needs more practice, I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems.\\n\\nEthan\\u2019s most recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers was scored at 56%. I recommend he watches the homework solution video and corrects his mistakes to deepen his understanding. If he continues to struggle, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great place to get extra help. Recordings are also available if he can\\u2019t attend live.\\n\\nIf Ethan would benefit from more personalized support, he is welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.

She was very engaged and attentive during class, keeping her camera on consistently, which really helped her stay connected. Emily answered 12 in-class questions with excellent accuracy\\u201411 were correct, and only one was partially correct (Question #1), showing strong understanding overall.\\n\\nThis week\\u2019s lesson focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines for predictions, and when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Emily demonstrated solid grasp of these concepts during class activities.\\n\\nRegarding homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, Emily scored 77%. To help her improve, I recommend she watch the homework solution video carefully and correct any mistakes. She can also work on extra problems in the supplemental workbook, which reinforce these skills.\\n\\nPlease encourage Emily to attend office hours on Tuesdays at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app if she needs extra help.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Yilia has been attentive and engaged in class this week, with her camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see. We focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Yilia answered 12 in-class questions, correctly solving 6, partially correct on 2, and struggled with questions #6, #7, #11, and #12. These particular questions indicate areas where she might benefit from additional practice to strengthen her understanding.\\n\\nRegarding her homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, she scored 73%. I encourage you to have Yilia watch the homework solution video to review her mistakes and help her improve her skills in borrowing from whole numbers during subtraction.\\n\\nTo support Yilia further, she can use extra supplemental problems in the workbook, and I am happy to provide additional practice problems upon request. Our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are also a great resource for homework and workbook help. If you feel Yilia would benefit from more personalized support, she has access to up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions this semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about her performance, you can view the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RNlAE7.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI wanted to share some thoughtful feedback about Nathan\\u2019s progress in math this week. He was engaged and attentive during our lesson on line graphs, consistently keeping his camera on and participating actively. Nathan answered 12 questions in class, getting 10 correct and missing only one. The question he answered incorrectly was #12, and he did not answer question #3. These are small areas we can work on together, and I encourage him to review those concepts using the supplemental problems in the workbook or by attending office hours.\\n\\nNathan did not complete last week\\u2019s homework on subtraction of mixed numbers. I encourage him to finish it as soon as possible and to make completing homework on time a priority moving forward. Staying current with assignments will help him build confidence and deepen his understanding.\\n\\nFor extra support, Nathan can access additional practice problems, attend our weekly office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, or watch recordings of past classes and office hours.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Divya,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Sitara\\u2019s progress in our recent math lessons. This week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and distinguishing when to use line graphs versus bar graphs.\\n\\nSitara has been consistently engaged in class and kept her camera on, which really helps her participation. Out of 10 in-class questions, she answered 6 correctly and 1 partially correct, although she struggled with questions 4, 5, and 6. These particular questions showed some difficulty, so I recommend reviewing those concepts together. Additionally, her previous homework on subtraction of mixed numbers earned a perfect score of 100%, which is excellent.\\n\\nTo support Sitara\\u2019s understanding, I encourage her to watch the homework solution video to reinforce concepts and help correct any mistakes. If she wants more practice, there are extra problems available in the supplemental workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide additional problems upon request. Also, office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app offer a great opportunity for homework and workbook help.\\n\\nIf you feel Sitara would benefit from more personalized attention, she can use up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester; you can book those here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on her in-class performance, you can view the full report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5aEN.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further resources to help Sitara thrive.\\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar\\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Divya\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bSitara\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u7684\\u6570\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u8fdb\\u5c55\\u3002\\u672c\\u5468\\u6211\\u4eec\\u91cd\\u70b9\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u3002\\n\\nSitara\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u5f88\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\uff0c\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u4e5f\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u5979\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5979\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8610\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6b63\\u786e\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e866\\u9898\\uff0c\\u67091\\u9898\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u4f46\\u5728\\u7b2c4\\u30015\\u30016\\u9898\\u4e0a\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u9898\\u76ee\\u53cd\\u6620\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u9700\\u8981\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u7684\\u5730\\u65b9\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u548c\\u5979\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u590d\\u4e60\\u76f8\\u5173\\u5185\\u5bb9\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5979\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5e26\\u5206\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u4e86100\\u5206\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u4f18\\u79c0\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u652f\\u6301Sitara\\u7684\\u5b66\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u6790\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5de9\\u56fa\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u989d\\u5916\\u4e60\\u9898\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u6839\\u636e\\u9700\\u6c42\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u9898\\u76ee\\u3002\\u53e6\\u5916\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u7b54\\u7591\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u662f\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u7684\\u597d\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Sitara\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6709\\u5173\\u5979\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u67e5\\u770b\\u5b8c\\u6574\\u7684\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5aEN\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u7591\\u95ee\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u5e2e\\u52a9Sitara\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\u3002\\n\\n\\u795d\\u597d\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

She answered 12 in-class questions, with 8 correct, 1 partially correct, 2 incorrect (specifically on questions #7 and #12), and 1 unanswered (#8). These particular questions could be a helpful focus area to review together, as addressing them will strengthen her grasp of the material.\\n\\nHer previous homework on subtracting mixed numbers scored 85%, which is solid progress. I encourage Iris to watch the homework solution video again and correct any mistakes she made, which will reinforce her understanding. If she needs more practice, the extra supplemental problems in the workbook are a great resource.\\n\\nTo support her further, please remind Iris about our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get help with homework and workbook questions. Also, recordings of classes and office hours are available if she cannot attend live sessions. Should you feel Iris would benefit from more personalized support, you are welcome to book up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Iris\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/9WaA16.

Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Evelyn,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Sophia's performance in this week's math class on line graphs and trend line analysis.\\n\\nSophia was fully engaged throughout the lesson, with her camera on and her attention focused on the material. She answered 10 in-class questions, getting 5 completely correct and 2 partially correct\\u2014a solid effort that shows she's grasping the core concepts. She did struggle with questions #4 and #10, as well as question #2 which she didn't attempt, so these are areas where a bit more practice could really help her confidence.\\n\\nI do want to gently flag that Sophia didn't complete her homework from last week on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I'd encourage her to go back and finish that work, as it builds foundational skills for upcoming topics. Moving forward, completing homework on time will help reinforce what we're covering in class.\\n\\nTo support Sophia's continued progress, I'd recommend she review the supplemental problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems.

Zoe demonstrated strong engagement and attentiveness throughout the lesson, keeping her camera on consistently, which really helps with participation.\\n\\nThis week we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Zoe answered 8 out of 10 in-class questions correctly, with 1 partially correct (question #3) and 1 incorrect (question #10). These specific questions are good points to review with her to reinforce understanding. Her previous homework on subtraction of mixed numbers was excellent, with a 99% score. I encourage Zoe to watch the homework solution video to correct any minor mistakes and deepen her understanding.\\n\\nTo support her continued growth, I recommend she try some extra problems from the workbook, which will provide more practice on these concepts. Please remind her that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app for any questions. Also, if you feel Zoe could benefit from personalized support, she is eligible for up to 3 free one-on-one tutoring sessions this semester\\u2014appointments can be booked through this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Zoe\\u2019s performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JOwopm.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Helen,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Isaac's performance this week in our line graphs lesson.\\n\\nIsaac was fully engaged throughout class and demonstrated strong focus and participation. He kept his camera on and was attentive as we explored how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines, and determine when line graphs are most effective compared to bar graphs. Out of 10 in-class questions, Isaac answered 6 correctly, with 2 partially correct responses. He did encounter some difficulty with questions #9 and #10, which suggests these particular concepts may need a bit more reinforcement.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Isaac scored 87% on the subtraction of mixed numbers assignment. This is solid work! I'd encourage him to review the homework solution video and correct any mistakes from that assignment\\u2014this will help strengthen his understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo support Isaac's continued growth, I'd like to suggest a few resources. The supplemental problems in the workbook offer great extra practice, and if Isaac would like additional challenges, I'm happy to provide more problems upon request. Our Tuesday office hours at 5 PM PDT are also a wonderful opportunity for homework and workbook help. Additionally, if Isaac would benefit from more personalized support, he has access to up to 3 free one-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester. You can book a session here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in Isaac's in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98Pq75\\n\\nThank you for your partnership in supporting Isaac's learning!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u81f3 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u4f11\\u606f\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 Helen\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u8fd9\\u6761\\u4fe1\\u606f\\u80fd\\u627e\\u5230\\u4f60\\uff0c\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5173\\u4e8e Isaac \\u672c\\u5468\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nIsaac \\u5728\\u6574\\u5802\\u8bfe\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u5f97\\u975e\\u5e38\\u6295\\u5165\\u548c\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u6253\\u5f00\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u63a2\\u7d22\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u3001\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u786e\\u5b9a\\u4f55\\u65f6\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u800c\\u975e\\u67f1\\u72b6\\u56fe\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u529b\\u3002\\u5728 10 \\u9053\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e2d\\uff0cIsaac \\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e86 6 \\u9053\\uff0c\\u6709 2 \\u9053\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7b2c 9 \\u548c\\u7b2c 10 \\u9898\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u7279\\u5b9a\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u9700\\u8981\\u8fdb\\u4e00\\u6b65\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cIsaac \\u5728\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u4e86 87 \\u5206\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u5f88\\u624e\\u5b9e\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u66f4\\u6b63\\u8be5\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u9519\\u8bef\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u5bf9\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u7684\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Isaac \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u51e0\\u4e2a\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u3002\\u8865\\u5145\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u95ee\\u9898\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u4e86\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u673a\\u4f1a\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c Isaac \\u60f3\\u8981\\u66f4\\u591a\\u6311\\u6218\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5f88\\u4e50\\u610f\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u95ee\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e5f\\u662f\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u7684\\u7edd\\u4f73\\u673a\\u4f1a\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c Isaac \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u4ed6\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4eab\\u53d7\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u3002\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u9884\\u8ba2\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u4f60\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728 Isaac \\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/98Pq75\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u4f60\\u5728\\u652f\\u6301 Isaac \\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5408\\u4f5c\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Catherine has had a strong week in class, showing great engagement and attentiveness throughout our lessons on plotting and interpreting line graphs. She answered 9 out of 10 in-class questions correctly, with just one question (#3) being partially correct. This demonstrates solid understanding of the material covered. Catherine also kept her camera consistently on, which I appreciate as it helps maintain focus and connection during our virtual sessions.\\n\\nFor homework, Catherine scored 62% on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. This area is a bit challenging for her, especially with borrowing from the whole number when needed. I recommend encouraging her to watch the homework solution video carefully and to correct her mistakes to deepen her understanding.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Angela's progress in this week's math lessons.\\n\\nAngela demonstrated strong engagement throughout our classes on line graphs and trend analysis. She was attentive, kept her camera on consistently, and actively participated in our discussions. On this week's in-class questions, Angela answered 8 out of 10 correctly\\u2014a solid performance! She did encounter some difficulty with questions #4 and #7, which tells me there are specific concepts in this week's material where she could benefit from some additional practice and review.\\n\\nI'm also pleased to see that Angela maintained her strong homework habits with a 96% score on last week's assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. That's excellent work! I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution video and take time to review any questions she may have gotten incorrect\\u2014this reflection really helps solidify understanding.\\n\\nTo support Angela's continued growth, here are some resources I'd recommend:\\n- The supplemental problems in the workbook offer great practice opportunities for reinforcing this week's concepts\\n- Angela can attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app for homework and workbook help\\n- If she'd like more personalized support, she has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about Angela's performance in the in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xNGe\\n\\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!\\n\\nBest regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u81f311\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5468\\u8fc7\\u5f97\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff01\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u5173\\u4e8eAngela\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nAngela\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u5206\\u6790\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u5f88\\u5f3a\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u5979\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u59cb\\u7ec8\\u5f00\\u542f\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u3002\\u5728\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u4e2d\\uff0cAngela\\u7b54\\u5bf9\\u4e8610\\u9053\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u76848\\u9053\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u4e0d\\u9519\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u5979\\u5728\\u7b2c4\\u9898\\u548c\\u7b2c7\\u9898\\u4e2d\\u9047\\u5230\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u8bf4\\u660e\\u672c\\u5468\\u7684\\u6750\\u6599\\u4e2d\\u6709\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u7279\\u5b9a\\u7684\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u5979\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u4ece\\u989d\\u5916\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u548c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4e2d\\u53d7\\u76ca\\u3002\\n\\n\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u5174\\u770b\\u5230Angela\\u5728\\u4e0a\\u5468\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u540c\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u548c\\u5f02\\u5206\\u6bcd\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u4e8696%\\u7684\\u9ad8\\u5206\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u51fa\\u8272\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u7b54\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u82b1\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u590d\\u4e60\\u5979\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u505a\\u9519\\u7684\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u2014\\u2014\\u8fd9\\u79cd\\u53cd\\u601d\\u771f\\u7684\\u80fd\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u52a0\\u6df1\\u7406\\u89e3\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301Angela\\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u662f\\u6211\\u63a8\\u8350\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u8d44\\u6e90\\uff1a\\n- \\u8865\\u5145\\u6559\\u6750\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\u4e3a\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6982\\u5ff5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u4e86\\u5f88\\u597d\\u7684\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u673a\\u4f1a\\n- Angela\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\u901a\\u8fc7Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u548c\\u6559\\u6750\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\n- \\u5982\\u679c\\u5979\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5979\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u53ef\\u83b7\\u5f973\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u5904\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u5173\\u4e8eAngela\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/96xNGe\\n\\n\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u6211\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\n\\u656c\\u793c\\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jayden,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Eason\\u2019s progress in math this week. He has been engaged and attentive during our lessons, consistently keeping his camera on, which has helped him stay focused throughout the class.\\n\\nWe covered how to plot and interpret line graphs, draw trend lines to predict future values, and discussed when line graphs are preferable to bar graphs. Eason answered 7 in-class questions; he got 3 correct, 2 partially correct (questions #2 and #3), 1 incorrect (question #7), and left 1 unanswered (question #1). This shows he is grasping many concepts but could benefit from some additional practice on the areas related to those particular questions.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Eason scored 65% on subtraction of mixed numbers, including borrowing when the fraction part is small. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video and correct his mistakes, as this can reinforce his understanding.\\n\\nTo support Eason further, he can work through extra problems in the workbook or request additional practice problems from me. Also, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great opportunity for him to ask questions and get help. If you feel Eason could benefit from more personalized support, please consider booking one of the up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester at this link: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about his in-class performance in this report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vXMAyV.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Nicole's performance in this week's math class on graphing and data interpretation.\\n\\nNicole was fully engaged throughout the lesson and demonstrated strong understanding of the core concepts. She answered 10 in-class questions with 7 correct responses, showing solid comprehension of plotting line graphs, finding trend lines, and determining when to use different graph types. I did notice she had some difficulty with Question #6 and gave a partially correct response to Question #3, so these are areas where she might benefit from additional practice. She also didn't attempt Question #1\\u2014if she feels uncertain about any concepts, I'm here to help clarify.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Nicole scored 72% on the mixed number subtraction problems. This is a solid foundation, but there's definitely room for improvement, especially with the borrowing concept. I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution video to see where she went off track and work through those corrections.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some feedback about Jamie's performance in this week's math class on line graphs and trend analysis.\\n\\nJamie demonstrated solid engagement during class and kept his camera on throughout, which I really appreciate. He answered 10 in-class questions this week, getting 5 completely correct and 3 partially correct. I noticed he had some difficulty with question #9 and questions #2, #3, and #8 where he didn't quite reach full accuracy. I also want to gently mention that Jamie arrived a few minutes late to class and experienced 3 brief disconnections during our session. I understand that sometimes things come up, but arriving on time helps him catch all the important foundational content\\u2014which may have contributed to him missing question #1 entirely. If there are any technical issues we can troubleshoot together, please don't hesitate to reach out to Think customer service for support.\\n\\nOn the homework front, I noticed that Jamie hasn't yet completed last week's assignment on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators. I'd love to see him complete this work, as it's an important foundation for what we're building. Going forward, completing homework on time will really help reinforce these concepts and set him up for success.\\n\\nTo support Jamie's learning, I'd recommend reviewing the supplemental problems in the workbook, and he's welcome to attend office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT for homework help.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving week! I wanted to share some positive feedback about Agnes's progress this week in our line graphs unit.\\n\\nAgnes has been consistently engaged and attentive during class, and I've really appreciated her active participation. She answered 10 in-class questions this week, getting 6 completely correct\\u2014that's a solid 60% success rate. I did notice she found questions #6, #9, and #10 more challenging, and question #3 was partially correct. These particular questions will help us identify specific areas where she might benefit from extra practice.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Agnes scored 81% on her mixed number subtraction assignment. While this is respectable work, I'd encourage her to watch the homework solution video and take time to correct her mistakes. This review process is invaluable for solidifying her understanding before we move forward.\\n\\nTo help Agnes continue building her confidence and skills, I'd like to suggest a few resources:\\n\\n- The supplemental problems in her workbook offer great additional practice opportunities\\n- She's welcome to request more problems anytime\\u2014I'm happy to provide them\\n- Office hours resume next Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, where she can get direct homework and workbook help\\n- If she'd like more personalized support, she has access to up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nAgnes is on a positive trajectory, and with a bit more targeted practice on these challenging question types, I'm confident she'll strengthen her graph interpretation skills.

He participated actively and stayed engaged throughout the class, with his camera consistently on, which is wonderful to see. Umair missed 5 minutes of class due to a brief disconnection, possibly during the break. To help him get the most from each session, please ensure his attendance is continuous and consider reaching out to Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nIn terms of performance, Umair answered 7 out of 10 questions correctly, with 1 partially correct and 2 incorrect responses. Specifically, questions #6 and #9 were challenging for him, and question #8 was partially correct. This indicates solid understanding overall, with a few areas for review.\\n\\nUmair\\u2019s homework on subtraction of mixed numbers was excellent, scoring 99%. I recommend having him watch the homework solution video to reinforce concepts and correct any small mistakes, ensuring mastery. For additional practice, he can work on extra problems in the workbook or request more exercises from me.\\n\\nPlease remind Umair that office hours are available every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where he can get extra help with homework or workbook questions.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share an update on Bryan\\u2019s progress in our math class this week. He has been very engaged and attentive throughout the lessons, and I appreciate that he consistently kept his camera on, which helps maintain our interactive environment.\\n\\nThis week, we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines to predict future values, and distinguishing when line graphs are more appropriate than bar graphs. Bryan answered 9 out of 10 in-class questions correctly, with his only challenge appearing on question #7. This shows a strong grasp of the material overall, and I\\u2019m confident with a little review he can master that last concept as well.\\n\\nRegarding homework, Bryan scored 73% on subtraction of mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators, including borrowing from the whole number. I encourage you to have him watch the homework solution video to review his mistakes and solidify his understanding. Additionally, he can work on extra supplemental problems in the workbook or request more practice if needed.\\n\\nBryan is welcome to join office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, which is a great opportunity for homework and workbook help. Recordings are also available if he cannot attend live sessions. Should he benefit from more personalized support, up to three free one-on-one tutoring sessions per semester are available and can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed insight into Bryan\\u2019s class performance, you can view the in-class report at https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JeZg8p.\\n\\nThank you for your support in helping Bryan continue to grow in math.

Think Academy is closed from Monday, November 24 to Sunday, November 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and Lesson 14 will resume next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDear James,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well as we head into the Thanksgiving break. I wanted to share some positive feedback about Daniel's performance in this week's class on line graphs and trend analysis.\\n\\nDaniel had an excellent week in class. He answered 10 in-class questions with 7 correct responses and 3 partially correct answers on questions #2, #3, and #8. His engagement was wonderful\\u2014he kept his camera on throughout, stayed attentive, and participated actively in our discussions. He was present for 88 of the 90 minutes, though he did experience one brief disconnection. If technical issues arise in the future, please ensure his internet connection is stable, and feel free to reach out to Think customer service if needed.\\n\\nOn the homework front, Daniel scored 85% on his work with mixed number subtraction. This is a solid effort! I'd encourage him to watch the homework solution video to review the questions he missed and understand the correct approach. This will help reinforce those concepts as we continue building his skills.\\n\\nTo support Daniel's continued growth, I recommend he explore the supplemental problems available in our workbook for extra practice. Additionally, our office hours every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app are a great resource for homework help. If he would benefit from more personalized support, I'd also like to mention that Daniel is eligible for up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which can be booked here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\nYou can find more detailed performance information in his in-class report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JxoxWw\\n\\nEnjoy your Thanksgiving week, and I look forward to seeing Daniel back in class next week!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nTeacher Omar\\n\\n---\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece 11 \\u6708 24 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u4e00\\u5230 11 \\u6708 30 \\u65e5\\u661f\\u671f\\u65e5\\u5173\\u95ed\\uff0c\\u5e86\\u795d\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c 14 \\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u5728\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684 James\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u8fd9\\u6761\\u4fe1\\u606f\\u5728\\u6211\\u4eec\\u8fdb\\u5165\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5047\\u671f\\u65f6\\u80fd\\u627e\\u5230\\u4f60\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u5173\\u4e8e Daniel \\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u548c\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u5206\\u6790\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u4e00\\u4e9b\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53cd\\u9988\\u3002\\n\\nDaniel \\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u8868\\u73b0\\u51fa\\u8272\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e86 10 \\u4e2a\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d 7 \\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c3 \\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u662f\\u7b2c #2\\u3001#3 \\u548c #8 \\u9898\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u5ea6\\u5f88\\u9ad8\\u2014\\u2014\\u4ed6\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u6253\\u5f00\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7684\\u8ba8\\u8bba\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u51fa\\u5e2d\\u4e86 90 \\u5206\\u949f\\u4e2d\\u7684 88 \\u5206\\u949f\\uff0c\\u867d\\u7136\\u4ed6\\u7ecf\\u5386\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u77ed\\u6682\\u7684\\u6389\\u7ebf\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u5c06\\u6765\\u51fa\\u73b0\\u6280\\u672f\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u8fde\\u63a5\\u7a33\\u5b9a\\uff0c\\u5982\\u9700\\u8981\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8054\\u7cfb Think \\u5ba2\\u670d\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5728\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u65b9\\u9762\\uff0cDaniel \\u5728\\u6df7\\u5408\\u6570\\u51cf\\u6cd5\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u4e2d\\u5f97\\u5206 85%\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u662f\\u4e00\\u4e2a\\u4e0d\\u9519\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\uff01\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u89e3\\u51b3\\u65b9\\u6848\\u89c6\\u9891\\uff0c\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4ed6\\u9057\\u6f0f\\u7684\\u95ee\\u9898\\u5e76\\u7406\\u89e3\\u6b63\\u786e\\u7684\\u505a\\u6cd5\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u5c06\\u6709\\u52a9\\u4e8e\\u52a0\\u5f3a\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u6982\\u5ff5\\uff0c\\u4e3a\\u6211\\u4eec\\u7ee7\\u7eed\\u63d0\\u9ad8\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u6280\\u80fd\\u505a\\u597d\\u51c6\\u5907\\u3002\\n\\n\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u652f\\u6301 Daniel \\u7684\\u6301\\u7eed\\u8fdb\\u6b65\\uff0c\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4ed6\\u63a2\\u7d22\\u6211\\u4eec\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u7c3f\\u4e2d\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u7684\\u8865\\u5145\\u95ee\\u9898\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u6b64\\u5916\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4eec\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u5348 5 \\u70b9 PDT \\u5728 Think Student \\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u662f\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u5bb6\\u5ead\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u7684\\u7edd\\u4f73\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c Daniel \\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u6211\\u8fd8\\u60f3\\u63d0\\u5230\\u4ed6\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6709\\u8d44\\u683c\\u83b7\\u5f97\\u6700\\u591a 3 \\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\u9884\\u8ba2\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u6210\\u7ee9\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/JxoxWw\\n\\n\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5047\\u671f\\u6109\\u5feb\\uff0c\\u6211\\u671f\\u5f85\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u518d\\u6b21\\u770b\\u5230 Daniel\\uff01\\n\\n\\u6e29\\u6696\\u7684\\u95ee\\u5019\\uff0c\\nOmar \\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nEnglish:  \\nDear Jessica,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well. Vincent had a productive week in class as we focused on plotting and interpreting line graphs, drawing trend lines, and understanding when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. He answered 8 out of 12 in-class questions correctly, with one partially correct response and two questions he found challenging\\u2014specifically questions #3 and #7. He also missed answering question #1. Overall, Vincent remained engaged and attentive during class, though his camera was mostly off; encouraging him to keep it on could help increase interaction and focus.\\n\\nVincent attended 89 out of 90 minutes, but there was one brief disconnection that might have been during the break. Please ensure his connection is stable to avoid missing important content, and feel free to contact Think customer service if technical issues persist.\\n\\nHis recent homework on subtracting mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators scored 42%. I recommend having Vincent watch the homework solution video to review his mistakes and improve his understanding. Additional supplemental problems are available in the workbook, and I am happy to provide more practice materials if needed.\\n\\nTo support Vincent further, remember that office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT via the Think Student app, where he can get help with homework or workbook questions. Also, we offer up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester, which you can book here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nYou can find a more detailed breakdown of Vincent\\u2019s performance in this week\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/vzoZLn.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Think Academy is closed from Monday Nov 24 to Sunday Nov 30 for Thanksgiving. Office hours and lesson 14 will be next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n\\nDear Parent,\\n\\nI hope you are doing well. I wanted to share some feedback about Cami\\u2019s performance in math class this week. We focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, how to draw trend lines and use them to predict future values, and when it is best to use a line graph versus a bar graph.\\n\\nCami was engaged and attentive during class, which is wonderful to see. She answered 12 questions in total, with 5 correct, 1 partially correct, and 3 incorrect. She did not answer 3 questions, including questions #1, #8, and #10. The questions she struggled with were #6, #7, and #11. I encourage her to review these concepts and ask questions during office hours or in class. Cami was present for 87 minutes of the 90-minute class, missing 3 minutes due to a brief disconnection. I recommend ensuring her camera stays on during class to help her stay connected and engaged.\\n\\nHer previous homework score was 62%. I encourage her to watch the homework solution video and correct her mistakes. Additional practice problems are available in the workbook, and I\\u2019m happy to provide more upon request. Office hours are every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings are available for those who can\\u2019t attend live. Cami is also welcome to book up to 3 free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions per semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can view Cami\\u2019s in-class report here: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaEN5e.\\n\\nThank you for your support!\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\u63d0\\u9192\\uff1a\\u672c\\u5468\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u6216\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff01Think Academy \\u4ece11\\u670824\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u4e00\\uff09\\u523011\\u670830\\u65e5\\uff08\\u5468\\u65e5\\uff09\\u56e0\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u653e\\u5047\\u3002\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u548c\\u7b2c14\\u8bfe\\u5c06\\u4e8e\\u4e0b\\u5468\\u6062\\u590d\\u3002\\u795d\\u60a8\\u611f\\u6069\\u8282\\u5feb\\u4e50\\uff01\\n\\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684\\u5bb6\\u957f\\uff0c\\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u987a\\u5229\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u548c\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bCami\\u672c\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u6211\\u4eec\\u672c\\u5468\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u4e86\\u5982\\u4f55\\u7ed8\\u5236\\u548c\\u89e3\\u8bfb\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\uff0c\\u5982\\u4f55\\u753b\\u51fa\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u7684\\u8d8b\\u52bf\\u7ebf\\u5e76\\u7528\\u5b83\\u9884\\u6d4b\\u672a\\u6765\\u7684\\u6570\\u503c\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u53ca\\u5728\\u4ec0\\u4e48\\u60c5\\u51b5\\u4e0b\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6298\\u7ebf\\u56fe\\u6bd4\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u6761\\u5f62\\u56fe\\u66f4\\u5408\\u9002\\u3002\\n\\nCami\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u5f88\\u6295\\u5165\\uff0c\\u6ce8\\u610f\\u529b\\u96c6\\u4e2d\\uff0c\\u8fd9\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002\\u5979\\u603b\\u5171\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u9053\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d5\\u9053\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u9053\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c3\\u9053\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u5979\\u67093\\u9053\\u9898\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u56de\\u7b54\\uff0c\\u5305\\u62ec\\u7b2c1\\u30018\\u548c10\\u9898\\u3002\\u5979\\u9047\\u5230\\u56f0\\u96be\\u7684\\u9898\\u76ee\\u662f\\u7b2c6\\u30017\\u548c11\\u9898\\u3002\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u590d\\u4e60\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u77e5\\u8bc6\\u70b9\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5728\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u6216\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u63d0\\u95ee\\u3002Cami\\u572890\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u51fa\\u5e2d\\u4e8687\\u5206\\u949f\\uff0c\\u56e0\\u77ed\\u6682\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\u9519\\u8fc7\\u4e863\\u5206\\u949f\\u3002\\u6211\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u786e\\u4fdd\\u5979\\u5728\\u4e0a\\u8bfe\\u65f6\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\u5f00\\u542f\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\u5979\\u66f4\\u597d\\u5730\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u548c\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5979\\u4e4b\\u524d\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a62%\\u3002\\u6211\\u9f13\\u52b1\\u5979\\u89c2\\u770b\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u8bb2\\u89e3\\u89c6\\u9891\\u5e76\\u7ea0\\u6b63\\u9519\\u8bef\\u3002\\u8865\\u5145\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u9898\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u627e\\u5230\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u9700\\u8981\\uff0c\\u6211\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u63d0\\u4f9b\\u66f4\\u591a\\u3002\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u65e0\\u6cd5\\u53c2\\u52a0\\u76f4\\u64ad\\u7684\\u5b66\\u751f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u5f55\\u50cf\\u3002Cami\\u6bcf\\u5b66\\u671f\\u8fd8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u6700\\u591a3\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u7684\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u5982\\u4e0b\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002\\n\\n\\u5982\\u9700\\u66f4\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u7684\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u4ee5\\u4e0b\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u67e5\\u770bCami\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u62a5\\u544a\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/RaEN5e\\u3002\\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff01\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}]}\n",

We focused on how to plot and interpret line graphs, how to draw trend lines, and when to use line graphs versus bar graphs. Alex was engaged and attentive throughout the lesson, and I appreciate that he kept his camera on, which helps foster a positive learning environment.\n",

These are good opportunities for us to review together, and I encourage him to ask questions if anything feels unclear. His overall participation was strong, and he showed a solid understanding of the main concepts.\n",
