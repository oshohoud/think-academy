    "1. Address the parent by name (use \"Parent\" if no name provided)\n",

    "4. Do not mention the specific areas that the in-class questions covered, beyond the general subject matter covered in the lesson. That information is not available to you.\n",
    "5. There is no need to mention detailed attendance data (e.g. how many minutes the student did or did not attend) if the student attended the entire lesson or was entirely absent.\n",
    "6. If the student was partially absent, describe attendance data in minutes, not percentages. Since the full class time is 90 minutes, you would say to the parent of a child who missed 10% of the class that the child \"missed 9 minutes of class\". Round to the nearest minute.\n",
    "7. Unless otherwise specified in the above instructions, mention and comment on the student's homework score (as a percentage). If the student did not complete the homework, say they did not complete it and encourage them to complete it. Do not provide feedback about specific questions on the homework, since that information is not available to you\n",
    "8. Provide actionable recommendations based on the data\n",
    "9. If student was absent, focus on homework feedback and offer catch-up resources\n",
    "10. If provided above, include the in-class report link at the end of the email and mention to the parent they can find more detailed performance information in it.\n",
    "11. Be encouraging but honest about areas needing improvement\n",
    "12. Include relevant resources based on student's needs. If recommending 1-on-1 tutoring, include the tutoring link in the email.\n",
    "13. Keep tone warm, professional, and personalized\n",
    "14. Keep the feedback part (not including extra section) between 200-300 words. If the extra section is present, it should be written ABOVE/BEFORE the main email body and is not included in the word count. If an extra section was not mentioned, ignore this instruction.\n",
    "15. Do NOT use generic template language\n",
    "16. Do NOT include a subject at the top of the email body\n",
    "17. Do NOT use asterisks ** to indicate bold, this is for markdown and does not work for plain text.\n",
    "18. After the English email, write the exact same email translated into Mandarin Chinese.\n",

I wanted to share some feedback on Johnson\\u2019s progress in math this week. He participated actively in our lesson on classifying polygons and quadrilaterals, maintaining good engagement and keeping his camera on throughout the class, which is wonderful to see.  \\n\\nJohnson answered 12 questions during class, with 5 correct, 1 partially correct (Question #1), and 6 incorrect (Questions #4, #6, #8, #10, #11, #12). These results show some areas where he could benefit from additional practice to build confidence and accuracy. He also missed about 2 minutes of class due to brief disconnections; to support continuous learning, please consider checking his internet connection or reaching out to Think customer service if needed.  \\n\\nRegarding homework, Johnson scored 50% on his recent assignment covering customary units of weight and capacity. This suggests he might find the conversions challenging right now, so I recommend reviewing the homework together and using the extra supplemental problems in the workbook for more practice. If you feel Johnson would benefit from more personalized support, please feel free to book one of the up to three free 1-on-1 tutoring sessions available this semester here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/.  \\n\\nAlso, remind Johnson that office hours are held every Tuesday at 5 PM PDT on the Think Student app, and recordings of classes and office hours are available if he cannot attend live.  \\n\\nYou can find more detailed information about his in-class performance in this report: https://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5oXN.  \\n\\nThank you for your support, and please don\\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if I can assist in any way.  \\n\\nWarm regards,  \\nTeacher Omar  \\n\\nChinese:  \\n\\u4eb2\\u7231\\u7684Sara\\uff0c  \\n\\n\\u5e0c\\u671b\\u60a8\\u4e00\\u5207\\u5b89\\u597d\\u3002\\u6211\\u60f3\\u4e0e\\u60a8\\u5206\\u4eab\\u4e00\\u4e0bJohnson\\u8fd9\\u5468\\u5728\\u6570\\u5b66\\u8bfe\\u4e0a\\u7684\\u8868\\u73b0\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u79ef\\u6781\\u53c2\\u4e0e\\u4e86\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u5206\\u7c7b\\u591a\\u8fb9\\u5f62\\u548c\\u56db\\u8fb9\\u5f62\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\uff0c\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u4e00\\u76f4\\u4fdd\\u6301\\u826f\\u597d\\u7684\\u4e13\\u6ce8\\u5ea6\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u4e14\\u5168\\u7a0b\\u5f00\\u7740\\u6444\\u50cf\\u5934\\uff0c\\u8868\\u73b0\\u975e\\u5e38\\u597d\\u3002  \\n\\nJohnson\\u5728\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u4e0a\\u56de\\u7b54\\u4e8612\\u4e2a\\u95ee\\u9898\\uff0c\\u5176\\u4e2d5\\u4e2a\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff0c1\\u4e2a\\u90e8\\u5206\\u6b63\\u786e\\uff08\\u95ee\\u9898#1\\uff09\\uff0c6\\u4e2a\\u9519\\u8bef\\uff08\\u95ee\\u9898#4\\u3001#6\\u3001#8\\u3001#10\\u3001#11\\u3001#12\\uff09\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u4e9b\\u7ed3\\u679c\\u663e\\u793a\\u4ed6\\u5728\\u67d0\\u4e9b\\u65b9\\u9762\\u8fd8\\u9700\\u989d\\u5916\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\uff0c\\u4ee5\\u589e\\u5f3a\\u81ea\\u4fe1\\u548c\\u51c6\\u786e\\u5ea6\\u3002\\u4ed6\\u56e0\\u4e3a\\u77ed\\u6682\\u7684\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u65ad\\u7ebf\\u7f3a\\u5e2d\\u4e86\\u5927\\u7ea62\\u5206\\u949f\\u7684\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u3002\\u4e3a\\u4e86\\u4fdd\\u8bc1\\u5b66\\u4e60\\u7684\\u8fde\\u8d2f\\u6027\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u60a8\\u5e2e\\u5fd9\\u68c0\\u67e5\\u4e00\\u4e0b\\u4ed6\\u7684\\u7f51\\u7edc\\u8fde\\u63a5\\uff0c\\u5fc5\\u8981\\u65f6\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u8054\\u7cfbThink\\u5ba2\\u670d\\u5bfb\\u6c42\\u6280\\u672f\\u652f\\u6301\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0cJohnson\\u6700\\u8fd1\\u5173\\u4e8e\\u81ea\\u5b9a\\u4e49\\u91cd\\u91cf\\u548c\\u5bb9\\u91cf\\u5355\\u4f4d\\u7684\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\u5f97\\u5206\\u4e3a50%\\u3002\\u8fd9\\u8868\\u660e\\u4ed6\\u76ee\\u524d\\u53ef\\u80fd\\u5728\\u5355\\u4f4d\\u6362\\u7b97\\u65b9\\u9762\\u6709\\u4e9b\\u56f0\\u96be\\uff0c\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u60a8\\u548c\\u4ed6\\u4e00\\u8d77\\u590d\\u4e60\\u4f5c\\u4e1a\\uff0c\\u5e76\\u5229\\u7528\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u518c\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u989d\\u5916\\u8865\\u5145\\u9898\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u66f4\\u591a\\u7ec3\\u4e60\\u3002\\u5982\\u679c\\u60a8\\u89c9\\u5f97Johnson\\u9700\\u8981\\u66f4\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u5316\\u7684\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u6b22\\u8fce\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u672c\\u5b66\\u671f\\u6700\\u591a\\u4e09\\u6b21\\u514d\\u8d39\\u4e00\\u5bf9\\u4e00\\u8f85\\u5bfc\\uff0c\\u9884\\u7ea6\\u94fe\\u63a5\\u662f\\uff1ahttps://outlook.office365.com/book/ThinkAcademyMiddleSchool1on1@thethinkacademy.com/\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u53e6\\u5916\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u63d0\\u9192Johnson\\uff0c\\u6bcf\\u5468\\u4e8c\\u4e0b\\u53485\\u70b9\\uff08\\u592a\\u5e73\\u6d0b\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff09\\u5728Think Student\\u5e94\\u7528\\u4e0a\\u6709\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u5982\\u679c\\u4ed6\\u4e0d\\u80fd\\u5b9e\\u65f6\\u53c2\\u52a0\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u89c2\\u770b\\u8bfe\\u7a0b\\u548c\\u529e\\u516c\\u65f6\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5f55\\u5236\\u89c6\\u9891\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u60a8\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u5728\\u6b64\\u62a5\\u544a\\u4e2d\\u67e5\\u770b\\u4ed6\\u8bfe\\u5802\\u8868\\u73b0\\u7684\\u8be6\\u7ec6\\u4fe1\\u606f\\uff1ahttps://www.thethinkacademy.com/j/Jn5oXN\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u611f\\u8c22\\u60a8\\u7684\\u652f\\u6301\\uff0c\\u5982\\u6709\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u95ee\\u9898\\u6216\\u9700\\u8981\\u5e2e\\u52a9\\uff0c\\u8bf7\\u968f\\u65f6\\u4e0e\\u6211\\u8054\\u7cfb\\u3002  \\n\\n\\u6b64\\u81f4\\uff0c  \\nOmar\\u8001\\u5e08\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}}]}\n",
