I'd like to personally welcome you and Maria to our Grade 4 Honors class at Think Academy! My name is teacher Omar, and I have a few important notes for you as a new family. 

1) Intake Phone Call or Form 

I have some intake questions I’d like to ask to get to know Maria better and develop a customized learning plan to help reach your goals. I would also love to answer any questions you may have for me. Please schedule a 15-minute parent-teacher phone call with me here. Note that these calls will be in English only, as I am still learning Mandarin! 

If you would prefer, you can answer these intake questions via a form linked here: https://forms.gle/citeKWa84UNa2WXb7. The form is written in English and Mandarin Chinese, and can take answers in both languages. Note that you do not need to complete the form AND schedule a phone call unless you’d prefer to do so. The questions on the form are the same ones I will ask during the call. 

2) My Contact Info 

You can reach me via 3 modes of contact: 

	Email: omar.shohoud@thethinkacademy.com 
	Think Parent app: Message me directly 
	Phone Call/SMS/WeChat/Whatsapp: +14254457108 

You may receive text messages from a different number which I use to send out mass texts, but you should use one of the methods above to contact me. Feel free to reach out anytime! Talk soon! Feedback is below. 
","Maria is a new student, be extra warm and welcoming in the email."
